        "*Sigh.....*\n\nIn order to not be completely dismissive, I guess I can see where you're coming from in that they are both higher pitched string instruments capable of vibrato and have a certain \"nasal\" quality. \n\nBut no, not at all. And sustain doesn't really have anything to do with timbre. \n\n[Bowed guitar](https://youtu.be/oOujjipuhtA) on the other hand... (though I would say the timbre is more similar to that of a cello)",
        "the attack is too different",
        "I always thought distorted guitar was more like the timbre of a saxophone.  When I first heard the Satisfaction riff back in '65, I really wasn't sure it was a guitar at all (is that a sax?)  It certainly enabled the guitar to growl and scream like rock'n'roll saxophone did in the 1950s - and allowed the guitar to take over as the supreme rock solo instrument. (1950s lead guitar tends to sound a little twangy and weedy next to those old sax solos.)",
        "You can't hear the guitar through the mass of effects on show there, so no I don't. The electric guitar sounds like a guitar, until you start lumping on the effects, then you can make it sound however you like, which is a whole world of noise, and why the electirc guitar is so popular.. You can even make it sound like a violin if you want.",
        "Electric guitar timbre is so malleable that generalizations like this make little sense.  Beyond the instrument itself, every guitarist has personal preferences in amplifiers and a wide variety of stomp box effects.  The overtone series is dependent on the selection of vacuum tubes in the amplifier - the \"British\" (Marshall) vs \"American\" (Fender) sound. \n\nIn this [Bill Frisell concert](https://youtu.be/ifr8IowlQIM) the difference in timbre between violin and electric guitar couldn't be more obvious.",
        "Not to be \"that guy\", but having played violin for about 35 years, and guitar for 30 (electric could be 29.5), they are very very different, especially the timbre. \n\nAlso, you seem to be referring to \"increased sustain and the distortion\". That, especially the second, has nothing to do with the instrument and everything to do with the musical wave signal over wires/air that is converted back to sound after going through many many things, including an amplifier.\n\nI have an effect that makes my Electric sound like a Violin(GR-55), and I have a pickup for a violin that allows me to make it sound like a sustained, distorted electric when picked. \n\nThe timbre is still quite different, though that is what makes them different sounding really! Even a fretted steel strung violin or a fretless 4 string electric guitar still sounds like a violin vs. a guitar. "

    "The \"jazz guitar\" timbre used in concert (classical) music composition.": [
        "As a guitarist who often plays jazz, I agree with you. There is a lot of possibilities within the world of clean electric guitar tones. The examples you gave are perfect. I think Metheny's tone is a little more 'bright' and clear (more treble or mids I suppose). Adam Rogers has got more of the dark, warm, bassy thing going on depending on the context. I like that warm tone, but I think some players let it get a tad too muddy for my tastes.\n\nAnywho, the electric guitar, by its very nature, offers vast timbral possibilities that could be massively useful in that context. I imagine it is just a matter of time before we see more of it. Hopefully?\n\nThe Los Angeles 8 are a guitar ensemble that plays electric guitars. Here is a [video of them playing the third movement of Steve Reich's electric counterpoint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFeWeyyZ7gE). I get the impression that they are trying to earn the electric guitar some street cred in the realm of concert music. The ensemble is different than the context you suggested, but it seemed relevant.",
        "If you want some amazing timbre experiments with guitar check out Glenn Branca's works, any of his symphonies and his Ascension are recommended. It's been called post minimalism and totalism so I'm not sure if that's what you're exactly looking for but they're worth checking out for anyone. ",

I also played in a premier of a piece by Guillermo Klein called *Solar Return Suite* that featured it.\n\nIt's a great sound that has tons of untapped potential.  I think the only reason it isn't used more is just that it's not standard.",

        "If you're having these types of problems, put your compressor before your EQ in the signal chain.  Then on your EQ, 700-800 is the magic range for that snappiness in the bass.\n\nAn alternative, and more dramatic, technique is to create a send for your bass channel to an auxiliary channel (pre-fader) and do the following:\n\n1) Compress the crap out of it: -35db threshold, 10:1 ratio, nastiness\n\n2) Run an amp simulator on it (SansAmp works fine).  Add some gain/drive, distortion, turn down the bass and turn up the mids and highs.  This shoudl give you a higher grungy distorted bass sound.\n\n3) Bring this down and gently bring it up into the mix.  You're not really wanting to hear this much audibly, but adding this textured double will help the bass cut through the mix a bit.",
        "I think you'll need to pay attention to dynamics, and not just frequency content. Have you tried playing with a compressor on your bass track?",

        "Alternative rock is a weird beast. And so is indie rock.\n\nFrom what I've read, alternative rock was originally a sort of umbrella term for rock music in the 80s that acted as a literal alternative to the mainstream rock of the time. And on places like RYM this concept was further expanded by adding genres like shoegaze and grunge as subgenres, basically taking the term literally and using the term as alternative kinds of rock.\n\nHowever, it seems that at some point in the 90s/00s it's basically become a sort of pop rock with a bit of an edge to it (not totally sure how to explain it), and the stuff I like falls more under that category. Is it *alternative rock* though? It's really confusing how it seems like there are basically two kinds of very different rock music put under the same name, kinda like with dubstep and brostep except without the latter extra term.\n\nIndie rock I've never been too familiar with, but it seems to have begun as independent rock music, played by smaller, unsigned bands with a DIY aesthetic. \n\nNowadays it seems more like a term for low-key highbrow and artsy rock music with a nerdish and introverted vibe, and the whole independent/DIY part seems to not really matter either way anymore.",

        "So, I'm using this as an excuse for a rant near and dear to my heart, but but but but hear me out...\n\nGlam rock.  '70s glam... yes, there were bubblegum artists with the glam look, and one of them (Slade) was arguably one of the pioneers (2nd wave, at least), BUT... Most of the notable glam guys - David Bowie, Lou Reed, Bryan Ferry, March Bolan, Steve Harley, Iggy Pop, David Johansen, Brian Eno, Ian Hunter, etc... - all had some legit philosophical edge, however well candy-coated.  They were at least reasonably well-read, showed it, and really made a trend of deconstructing societal/culture norms within a pop culture/media context, and were sometimes pretty open about it.  There were questions of gender identity, drug use, how people construct subjective realities (particularly as related to media), cultural influence and critical evaluations of the formation of history and its bias toward Western culture... And sure, campy little jokes about Vaslav Nijinsky and Jean Genet and Marlene Dietrich, and cars and self-aware rock & roll tropes (ironic or not) and blah blah blah.  But these were guys who, whether one feels any specific individual was successful at it or not, were clearly \\*trying\\* to be artists.  There are very few movements within MAINSTREAM music that most music nerds agree, like the music or not, were dominated by a self-consciously artistic and \"pure\" intent, and that early/mid-70s glam era seems to be one of them.\n\nSo HOW it's become, in casual discussion or in most online forums but the snobbiest, synonymous with '80s \"glam metal\" is bizarre, and how people lump them together as though it were '70s vs. '80s punk.  I mean, no disrespect to '80s \"glam\" if that's what people like, but to compare it uniquely to '70s glam rock in any way other than dudes wearing makeup (and wasn't that just the '80s music scene, fullstop?).  Its intent - how its big names presented their views of fame and life and media and philosophy/poetry and \\*understanding\\* of sexuality - was very different.  Outside of \"genre\", I feel like people generally want to talk about Lou Reed/David Bowie vs. Motley Crue/Poison for very different reasons and from very different angles, right?  Not to mention when 10 years ago or so it was unironically claimed by fashion media outlets to describe contemporary \"flamboyant\" looks on the red carpet (ok Lady Gaga's glam got it), but I fucking digess.  Teen drama version of a hipster singer-songwriter throws on a scarf and a see-through top?  He's glam!  Sorry, more digression.\n\nI'd also say emo - venomously \\*socio\\*political hardcore punk to dudes with lip rings whining about some girl in some midwestern state... I mean, c'mon.  But I'm not as angry about that one, so... the end!"

That's probably some sort of confirmation bias on my part though...either way, they're beautiful looking and sounding guitars. I've been fighting the urge to order one, even though I'm sure I'd love it! \n\nThe best thing for me since discovering Nick's music is that I'm no longer too bothered about changing my strings as often as i might otherwise have done. Several sources have stated he played with super dead old strings and I must admit, the deader my current set get, the more I like them!",

But a big question of mine is just how much of his music did he record using a classical style guitar?

    "ELI5: How do we perceive different timbres or qualities of sound? I understand that sound is vibrations of the air which are picked up by our eardrums and other parts of the inner ear, but how do the sound waves created by, say, a guitar, differ from the sound waves created by a piano?": [
        "Almost no instrument produces a pure tone.  The flute is about the closest.  Generally, an instrument produces a load of notes that make up the harmonic series.  These are notes whose frequencies are a whole number multiple of times the base (or fundamental) frequency.  So, when you hear a piano playing 440Hz concert A, you're also hearing a little bit of the A an octave higher at 880Hz, and the E above that at 1320Hz, and the A at 1760Hz, etc.\n\nThe exact mix of these notes is what determines tone or timbre.\n\nYou can see this for yourself.  Download a free spectrum analyser app and sing in to it.  If you whistle, you'll see a sharp peak, pretty close to a pure tone.  Now sing a few different vowels and you'll see a bunch of spikes.  As you keep the note the same but change the vowels, you'll see the lowest not stays in the same place, but the higher tones change in position and amount.",
        "This is actually more of a physics question!\n\nWhen you play a note on a guitar, you are taking that string, causing it to vibrate at a certain frequency, thus creating the basic sound wave you mention. A piano does the same exact thing, just using a hammer to strike the string. \n\nBut sound doesn\u2019t stop there. Sound from the guitar string bounces around the inside of the guitar, causing the waves to interact with each other, creating sound waves that look quite different from the typical sine wave you usually see when discussing sound. \n\nThe same thing for the piano, which is why you can hear a difference between a basic upright piano and a grand piano. Different structures cause the sound to resonate differently, causing the same note to sound different depending on the instrument"

The important questions is your own goals, if you like classical repertoire I'm sure many pieces will still sound nice played on steel strings, and if you enjoy the music that you're playing then no it wouldn't be a waste of time to practice those tunes on your current instrument.

        "I played fingerstyle on a steel string for about 4 years before getting a classical. Now all I do is use the classical. I don't even play classical music, I just love the tone and control with nylon strings. ",
        "I studied classical guitar and play folk music predominantly but do not enjoy playing folk on my classical guitar. I will swear to my grave that the difference in strum sound due to the fret board with is very noticeable and I prefer the narrower neck for that style. I occasionally use it for nice finger-picked folk tunes but even then I often prefer to just switch guitars as I find the timbre of steel strings preferable for the style.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for learning classical songs on a steel string guitar (I assume this when you say folk guitar)... I don't mean to sound like a snob but I think it generally makes a poor substitute unless you are very good. Nylon strings are just a lot easier for beginners to get nice clear notes with and it will lead to a lot less frustration. You can get half decent classicals from cordoba and yamaha for under 200 bucks. They aren't performance level instruments but that shouldn't be the goal a newer player. Once you've gotten some decent pieces under your belt, upgrade then and flip the beater on craigslist or something.",

Take into account double-tracking/overdubbing, and other studio magic that went into making the sounds. I would also experiment on how you route the effects too. Like modulation into pitch-shifting, I bet you can get some wild sounds from that!\n\nI can take educated guesses what effects are used on each song:\n\n**Peacebone** - Pitch-shifter and (maybe) light distortion\n\n**Unsolved Mysteries** - Pitch-shifter and tremolo (the main guitar is a sample being pitch shifted)\n\n**Chores** - I don\u2019t think there is actually a guitar being played on this track until the outro. My guess is that the rhythm guitar is a sample being played chromatically, which is why it sounds so other-worldly. That sampled guitar is probably just a guitar with the slap-back effect that is heavily used on Feels. For the outro guitar (the sporadic *boings*) I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a delay and phaser.\n\n**For Reverend Green** - Rhythm guitar: pitch-shifter, tremolo (hence the choppiness), and distortion. Lead: pitch-shifter, delay, and maybe phase/flange, and it\u2019s all double-tracked.\n\n**Fireworks** - There\u2019s that Feels slap-back again! But with some added tremolo. I think there\u2019s some phase going on too. \n\n**#1** - pitch-shifter and tremolo. Maybe a volume pedal too because it kinda has a swell to it.\n\n**Winter Wonder Land** - Pitch-Shifter\n\n**Cuckoo** - Pitch-shifter and Tremolo, with a touch of slap-back\n\n**Derek** - Pitch-shifter, delay, phase. There\u2019s a pan-flute sounding synth playing a harmony with the guitar too so it might sound exactly right without that.\n\n\nI hope this helps!! I know this is not in great detail, so if there are any questions on how to dial in the sounds, I can hopefully help with that too. ",

The compensation you need to have good intonation changes depending on how far away the strings are from the top. If you have good intonation and then lower the action a lot, you might notice the intonation is off. Also depending on how far the strings are from the soundboard, you can get a different quality of sound. If the strings are too far away or too close, the sound will choke.\n\nFrom what you are saying about buzz on the first and second frets, it sounds like it the buzz is being caused by a high fret. You should have a luthier look at the fretwork before adjusting the action to correct the buzz.",

To the point of muscle memory.  You want to get the guitar playing down to the point where you don't have to spend active brain energy on that - so you can focus on singing and guiding your way through the song.  \n\nYou'll also need to develop some good strumming techniques.  The ability to keep a steady beat.  The ability to accent certain beats or insert a pause on other beats.  Again, lots of practice to get your strumming hand familiar with moving the pick through the strings.  I'd also highly recommend you use a metronome, even from day 1.  A metronome will help you develop an internal sense of rhythm.\n\n>I wish to write my own songs. \n\nThis will involve knowing some music theory.  For 99% of pop oriented music, you'll want to focus on the major scale.  Learn the notes of the scale.  Next add on top of that how to harmonize the major scale.  This means you take those notes and build each of them into chords.  This will give you a set of chords that will all 'fit' in that key.  \n\nSo say you want to write a song.  Pick a key.  Let's use C.  The notes in the C major scale are C D E F G A B.  You can turn each of those notes into a chord.  C major, D minor, E minor, F major, G major, A minor, B dim.

But I also want to say that many great guitar players didn't always use 'proper' technique.  SRV, Hendrix, and Clapton didn't use their pinky that much.  Albert King played his guitar upside down.  James Hetfield holds his pick weird.  Johnny Ramone set his guitar strap way too low.  Marty Friedman has a really weird angle on his picking wrist.  Jimmy Page could be downright sloppy at times.  \n\nI am not advocating that you intentionally learn poor technique.  But I just want to say that I also wouldn't get so totally hung up on it that you don't learn any technique.  A teacher can be a helpful guide, but you still want to self-learn.  And you'll need to.  Think of a teacher more as someone who helps guide and direct your ship.  But you still have to power the ship and move it forward.  You'll still need to spend a lot of time, effort, and energy developing these skills.  "

        "[Harmonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic).\n\nYou can have a synthesizer play you a pure sine wave.  It has a specific sound.  Most instruments and sounds in real life have \"harmonics\", multiples of the base frequency overlapped on top of it.\n\nThink of it as a deep wave out at sea that also has wind ripples on top of it.\n\nPiano hits strings with a hammer, and the sound resonates in a big block of bronze metal, and guitar strings are plucked with a pick, and the sound resonates in a hollow cavity surrounded by wood.  So even if the strings formed a \"pure\" sine tone, all the resonating and different materials add \"distortions\" (harmonic waves that are multiples of the base tone, that \"fade\" in different ways\").\n\nFor a piano especially, the sound changes over time as it fades.",
        "Neither of these instruments makes a pure tone.  That's what a tuning fork or electronic synthesizer makes.\n\nBoth instruments make a mixture of many frequencies, with the peak tuned to the same note.  The timbre difference is the relationship between all those other frequencies to the primary frequency.",
        "As others have stated. Harmonics or overtones are what define the timbre, or sound quality, in instruments.\n\nPlucking a the lowest string on a guitar (E) will produce a fundamental tone or frequency of 82 Hz. What makes it 'sound' like a guitar is the layering of the harmonics or overtones on top of that main tone. The cool thing about harmonics is that they are whole number multiples above the main tone.\n\nExample: The loudest tone heard when plucking the low string on a guitar would be 82 Hz but you would also hear 162 Hz, 264 Hz, 328 Hz, 410 Hz, 492 Hz, 574 Hz, 656 Hz, and so on - up the our limit of hearing. (82 Hz X 1, 82 Hz X 2, 82 Hz X 3, etc ).\n\nEach of these frequencies represents  different notes other than the 'E' note that was plucked on the guitar. The timbre, or sound quality, of the instrument is defined by how loud each of those overtone frequencies, or notes, is. The mechanical action of the string vibrating is what causes these overtones. Otherwise it would just sound like a [pure sine wave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ5G13MEMgc).\n\nTo complicate things, keys on pianos have anywhere from 1 to 3 strings. It's impossible to perfectly tune 2 or 3 strings to be EXACTLY in tune with each other. This creates an even more complex sound since you are actually hearing notes that are slightly off from each other (i.e. 80 Hz, 82 Hz, 83 Hz) with their respective overtones. If the strings are way out of tune from each other, you start to get that [honky tonk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdD5oAhOgfs&list=RDsdD5oAhOgfs&start_radio=1) sound.\n\nThis is an oversimplification of what is going on with timbre but hopefully gets the point across. There are many other factors like string length, attack (plucking, finger picking, piano hammer), and instrument build (guitar body shape, piano size, etc) that also contribute to timbre.",
        "The number of overtone layers on top of the fundamental of the note.

A saxophone may have four. That is, you\u2019re not just playing purely A4 with an A4 configuration. You may have A5 or A6 or A3 to different amounts according to different instruments. The mixture of the different frequencies, combined with other factors such as the medium to which the sound travels (wood or string or air or brass) and amplitude of each frequency, results in what we perceive as different timbre, There\u2019s an amazing lecture by Walter Lewin on musical instruments that demonstrates this.",

    "ELI5: What makes the timbre of a guitar and piano so different? They're both string instruments, so shouldn''t they sound somewhat similar?": [
        "They do have some things in common - they're both vibrating strings that are amplified by a wooden chamber for the sound to reverberate (in the case of an acoustic guitar and grand piano).\n\nThe primary difference is what causes the string to make its sound:\n\nA guitar uses a nylon or steel string that's plucked using a fingertip or plastic pick.\n\nA typical piano key is actually three different steel wires that are all struck simultaneously by a hammer covered in felt.\n\nThere are lots of other differences, like the tension of the string, the methods used to stop the vibration, the range of possible notes that can be played, the number of simultaneous notes, and so on.\n\nA surprising range of sounds can be made by instruments that are surprisingly similar. A violin is a string instrument and similar in many ways to a guitar, but it has a very different sound in large part because it's played with a bow, but there are many other subtle differences that overall lead to a quite different sound.\n",
        "Now we're talking about resonance and what amplifies the vibrations from the strings and out to the air. \n\nBoth size of the resonance chamber (or lack thereof), and the materials used to make it comes into play with distinguishing sounds. \n\nMost wooden string instruments are hollow, allowing the sound to bounce back and forth inside the body of the instrument, and the amount of bouncing the sound does, influences the sound. A piano is much bigger than a guitar, so the sound bounces a lot, making a rounder, softer tune. "

    "are drops REALLY just a sub, kick/snare, and pieced-together midrange basses?": [
        "I feel like drops are more about controlling dynamics. The use of silence and controlling the dynamics for the low, mid and high spectrums tend to make drops more impactful in my mind. You can have a super dope melody/progression but if it's the same volume or transients the entire song it's going to sound flat and boring.",
        "What Ive found over the years is that my biggest hitting drops are the ones with the least stuff going on... \n\nWe all know about the idea of playing with tension/release, but it's really a matter of contrast, for the release to feel good you need to have contrast from the post where there is tension, so it really depends on what genre/arrangement/elements/structure you are doing.\n\nIn my case I mostly do techno/house, and I used to think that to get a great drop you need to have STUFF that makes it hit harder, but after years Ive realised that is usually the LACK of stuff that makes it so.\n\nAs an example, say you've got a synth line with a filter that opens with a plucky envelope, and to build tension during the break, you start making the envelope longer and make it so it opens the cutoff more. \nWhat I used to do was, once it got to the drop Id leave the filter open and screaming at high frequencies, but now I automate it so once it gets to the drop it goes back to a plucky env and really lower the max cutoff compared to the break, that always works... Try it out.\n\n I think the opposite could work too... So if you have a break where you start taking elements off to create tension, you can make a drop where suddenly everything comes back together.\n\nI can leave with a personal example where I created this song just playing around with a piano and I got a loop I really liked with a \"bassline\" and some syncopated chords, and just playing around with different combinations of the parts, I ended up leaving a drop where the only things remaining  would be the kick, sub and the chords, taking out all other percussions,melodies and even the bassline, and that ended up being my favorite part of the track.

        "Dubstep drops like the ones Au5 and Virtual Riot create are far more heavily focused on rhythm and sound design than traditional music theory. They are absolutely writing in a different way than you're used to. It's the groove that's most important. Dubstep producers almost always start with a drum pattern and a bass line. Anything else is just icing on the cake. \"Clean\" sounding drops are all about clear separation [between frequencies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEWr5UJMqUA&ab_channel=OfficialAHEE) and phrases, and forget dynamics. Modern dubstep covets loudness above all else.\n\nThat said, it's still possible to have heavy dubstep drops that are based on progressions as you're used to writing them. Just listen to some of [Kai Wachi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92LyvMLvIWg&ab_channel=UKFDubstep) or [Sullivan King's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq0ejJ2afEs&ab_channel=DubstepGutter) stuff.",
        "Yeah but mr bill makes experimental bass music, every track is a sound design experiment not really a \u201csong\u201d. \n\nReally I think the lesson is start with the most important part of the track. For a melodic song that might be a progression, but for wook bass its going to be a sub bassline or synth glitch",
        "Possibly, but there is a huge range between melodic electronic music and, say, riddim. Ever heard of triphop? Tipper, Jade Cicada, Charlesthefirst etc. all do plenty of sound design and chordal/melodic elements as well. It's a matter of taste how much you want your music to be on one side or the other",
        "It depends on the genre. Depending on the genre, giving the mid-range basses the main stage and the production techniques around that are the main staples of the genre. In Riddim and Brostep there are barely any chords in the drop. In FutureBass fat chord stacks are the main element of the drop. But there is also Melodic Dubstep like Teminite or Chime. Also, generally just keep at it. \"I like the X and Y of genre A, but I'm kinda missing the beautiful <whatever it is> from genre B\" is usually a great starting place for building your own niche, maybe found a new genre.\n\nTo add some more directly applicable notes: In the cases of Au5 and Virtual Riot, they vary in their tracks, but I watched both of them \"sneak\" chords in kinda through the backdoor.\n\nVirtual Riot almost always has an Arp in the background that supports the drop with a chord progression. Often even very beautiful ones, almost jazzy with some 7s/9s/11s. But it is usually extremely plucky, in the background and sidechained to the main basses. \"In the background\" meaning almost not noticeable. They really play just a supportive role, you feel them more than you hear them. Au5 tends to use more pad-like sounds for his chord progressions, but also arps similarly. But again, very in the background. ducking away from the main basses and drums whenever possible. They are heavily automated (or sidechained) - in and out at very carefully chosen places, you only really 'hear them', when there is no other element that they would distract from\n\nAnother technique that totally can work (Teminite does it all the time, and the more Melodic Dubstep Virtual Riot tracks too) is putting them in the same spot as the basses, but only very briefly. When you look at most Dubstep-related genres, the drop is cleverly rotating 3 - 5 main elements over the underlying drum pattern. They take turns in very quick succession, it's rare that any single sound occupies the \"main stage\" even for a whole bar. You can totally do that with chords too, where you write a basic chord progression like you always would over the drum pattern. And then instead of letting the chords play out and fill the sonic spectrum all the time (like you would in most traditional music), you cut out the \"interesting\" parts of the chord progression (i.e. the important chord changes) and you make as much room between them as possible, but you leave the chord changes in there and build all the other bass sounds around the main progression. Depending on the style and feeling you want to achieve, the notes of the chord are again often not played out all at the same time, but rather outlined by an arp or a very fast lead.\n\nApropos lead, the last tip I want to give is: EDM is all about production. The sounds in EDM are usually heavily layered. But you can pull of chords even while a mid-range bass sound is playing. You just have to be **very** aware of where you place notes sonically. Taking a modern EDM drop and throwing a huge Pad on there that plays supporting chords usually won't work. The pad sonically fights with the main elements. Instead You will have to spread the notes of your chord over the whole instrumentation, similar to if you're writing for multiple instruments in an orchestra. d. So you can let the sub play one note, put one note in the lower bass register, Another one or two in the mid-rangey bass and one or two notes in the very high layers of a sound. One of those being the 'lead like' sound that is often layered in. This voice usually lends itself very well to the 'spiciest' note in the chord.",
        "I think it depends a lot on the specific genre you are working in. A lot of future bass (Illenium, Porter Robinson, some Seven Lions songs) is more driven by the chords and melodic leads",
        "Less stuffin your drop, the more powerful it is.  The trick is if you want a lot of stuff.. that STUFF needs to be playing at the time other stuff ISNT. So each individual element can be loud and present, but then gets out of the way of the kick snare and hi-hats.    \n\n\nI've been producing dance music for 12 years now.. and after about 6 years, I learned that my biggest sounding stuff is the stuff that has the least amount elements playing at any given time.",
        "I feel like a lot of the specific artists you cite do have memorable chord progressions and melodies in the drop. But they may be in the background of or in a call-and-response pattern with the trippy sound design stuff.",
        "In electronic music, the designed sound IS the music. The traditional elements of harmony and melody are not only less important, but focusing on them can make everything sound cheesy and terrible.\n\nEdit: Of course this comment on a meant to be taken 100% literally and applies to every sub genre and every single piece of electronic music ever written. There\u2019s no such thing as Switched on Bach, Flaming June, or a Deadmau5 song titled \u201cSome Chords\u201d",
        "A good drop has a strong rythmic quality to the bass and I find a lot of songs, even some mr bill ones, cram as many different cool basses as they can in and they always fall flat because the arrangement of them isn\u2019t interesting rhythmically.\n\nIMO Koan Sound has amazing drops, often with melodic elements as well:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4rxhSyoupRQ\nhttps://youtu.be/-4E4_SL_r8E\nhttps://youtu.be/c-57BcVsGqQ\n\nIt\u2019s all about having a huge switch of any kind at the point of the drop. If you want an example of a track that is massive as fuck both before and after the drop, I think this is a great one:\nhttps://youtu.be/vIo14jKF9uI\n\nSome examples of differences are, having stereo separation during the build-up and a merged centre after the drop.. cutting out bass before and bringing it in after.. quarter notes before and triplets after.. more/less melodic before/after (either combination works).. no drums before, drums after.\n\nThe more elements change on the drop, the more intense it is, but it still has to be somewhat predictable - you have to be able to partially predict how things might sound after the drop, otherwise it sounds like a different song and is too jarring. For example, a bpm change at the drop might be too jarring, as it is too large of change and ruins the expectation the listener has built up in regards to the rhythm of the song. If anyone pulls that off successfully, though, damn that song will go hard as fuck.\n\nAnother great example for drops is big room house. Personally I don\u2019t like it, but it really shows that you can have a high intensity buildup and a very minimal and simple drop and still have the song hit hard and work. You\u2019ve essentially turned everything off except the kick drum, and sometimes a plucky synth, yet the song still goes hard. Why is that?",
        "I had the same issue/question for a while lol. I think what helped me is realizing that the random elements make up the chord a lot of the times. Like the sub might be a G, and the lead sound might be a D and the weird glitchy sounds might be a B or alternate between them. And all together you have a G chord even if it doesn\u2019t necessarily sound like it \n\nHope that makes sense",
        "So, even as someone who doesn't write music, I think about this a lot. I love listening to weird experimental music, but sometimes I get in my head about the musicality sometimes when I hear a song and it feels like a collection of sounds over a beat rather then something more cohesive.\n\nBack when I was trying to learn music production one of the tutorials I watched was the Tom Cosm dubstep/glitchop production tutorial. It was so interesting and helpful ,but it was basically what you are saying. Getting a bunch of sound design elements to line up in a way that feels really good. To be fair, I think there are ways to do go about it which provide more musical coherence (all that theory and structural knowledge I lack lol). \n\nI am always really impressed when producers work some weird sound design, figure out what makes it great, develop that part of it, and squeeze it into a song between a bunch of other stuff and it will fit without sounding too busy. Sometimes though the sounds are too complex to be layered and need to be kept separate. I think, especially for \"banging drops\", simplicity can be a key element in getting something to fucking slap. If drops are overcomplicated then they can lose the magic. \n\nMaking sound design sound clean is the biggest piece of black magic great producers have. I had a buddy make an album, but at the end of the process he had to rebuild one of his first songs on a new computer. The song was the same but the difference in sound quality was astounding. Essentially, every part of the song was just built with better production workflows that he had adopted over the course of the album (better drum samples, better plugins, better swing, proper filtering, more concise effects, better management of the file, etc). I think that some of the \"clean\" factor is just developing a better ear and better producing habits.\n\nAt the end of the day, the most important thing is: If a song FUCKING SLAPS then it is UNDENIABLE. How you get there feels irrelevant if the end result pops. For the stuff that Mr Bill makes, where sound design is one the central points of focus, I think it makes sense to orient the process around those elements.\n\nHowever I'm just an enthusiastic listener so I might be super off base. Maybe someone is about to come in here and just be like \"use this drop plugin for fire shit every time\" lol.",
        "EDM drops are more or less clever sound design, distilled down to individual clips of audio, arranged in a way that is musically coherent, and then optimized, iterated, and improved to get a great result from a average \"demo\".    You cant approach it with the same mindset as other genres, or jamming or something like that.    its more like creating CGI, or doing computer based animation via code or something like that, where you have sets of things that need to happen over time, and then you arrange it so it does that to have the illusion of being musical.     I mean this in the way that it's not very efficient to do much in real time,  like having multiple sounds and trying to edit them in real time to work together is usually the wrong approach.\n\ntheres quite a lot of hard rules as far as the bass drop formula goes as well, and if you know these rules it gets easier to do \"crazy\" sound design because it kind of has an illusion of being crazy and random but theres specific sounds that are allowed to happen at each part of the beat.  (turnaround, 1 sound, filler sound, which parts you can glitch etc.)",
        "What is a \"drop\"?",
        "This is a point I cannot stress enough:\n\nMove your basses to audio and preset\nDon\u2019t do sound design in the same session that you then plan on writing your songs in.\n\nI know this is something we hear often, but don\u2019t underestimate it. Doing so allows for much easier manipulation of bass into new sounds through chopping cutting and rearranging and allows you to focus almost entirely on arrangement and mixing which can lead to a much more coherent drop. The cost with samples is that you can get artifacts when pitch shifting- often these lead to cool and unintended sounds or even this limitation results in you finding funky ways around it that you wouldn\u2019t do otherwise. I\u2019ve slept on this advice for at least 1.5 years and started doing it about 2 months ago and my productivity on songs has gone up so much, and being able to focus purely on writing the drop instead of sound design at the same time seems to result in drops that just work better for me\n\nTo add to that if it\u2019s a more harmonic bass instead of general glitch mess/sine compression/etc you can keep it as a preset to follow the key of the chord progression in your drop to avoid having to work around pitch shifting artifacts\n\nThe answer is pretty much yes, but it\u2019s also important to remember that these people are incredibly good at what they do :)",

        "There are many things you can do, but there is no formula to perfect music. It is all about knowing what you want to add to make your song better and when. Also, as a fellow virtual riot fan, depending on what style of his music you like you just need to know what it consists of. For example, his melodic dupstep is made of chord stacks and glitchy fills and percussive breaks, his riddim consists of basses, sub, drums and FX. Also keep in mind that sometimes less is more, your music might get too cluttered and messy if you add too much so practice and listen to other music to get a feel for the good measure.",
        "Drops are that simple yeah (but also not simple). If you\u2019re talking Riddim or IDM, I don\u2019t think drops really have prominent chords.\n\nA musician on TikTok, Evan Blair, explained this really well:\n\nFewer carefully-chosen, carefully mixed sounds will always sound bigger than a million voices put together. The reason is because there is finite sonic space \u2014 that\u2019s your canvas. It\u2019s why conversations are louder and clearer in your room than in a club where everyone\u2019s shouting\n\nFilling out a drop can be tricky though. \n\n1) The sounds need to be good and powerful in the right areas. Bass = \ud83d\udc51 and will always take the center\n\n2) *Background noise* (white noise or natural crowd noise/other foley). Imagine like a nature canvas \u2014 if you draw a couple birds, a small sun in the corner and horizon line, it gives the illusion of depth right? But a bunch of scribbles don\u2019t\n\n3) Sounds need to be focused. In a painting, the focus areas need to stand out from the rest.

Albeit, pretty much most electronic music layers sines underneath to pack more weight behind it, unless it's house, then that's really just the kick carrying the weight of the track.\n\nFor instance If I design a Reece bassline I will tend to split that sound and EQ them as 2 different instruments, they will then be processed a certain way. One for sub and for mid, I could then process it get it more warmth and dynamics.\n\n The quality of your drum samples matter a lot as well. \n\nBut from my own personal experience, you can polish a turd and make even the most basic idea sound Wicked. Honestly I kinda feel it's the advanced production that make the track hit as hard as it does. Giving everything it's own space and allowing the more weighty elements to cut through.\n\nI produce DNB so really you have to nail those main elements or else you got shite.

I understand your struggle, and what I've done that really helps when writing drops is to write a simple piano melody, and then create bass sounds that follow the same notes and rhythm as your piano melody. The key here is to keep the melody simpler than you would if it was being played by a melodic instrument. The sound design will fill in the gaps and make your simple/not that interesting melody sound great in context of the song. Also, utilize a click track, which contains the rhythm you want the drop to follow. After laying everything out, mute your piano melody and click track and boom you have a drop. At this point you can adjust your track to fit around your drums or vice versa.",

Some drops use big supersaw chords instead of midbasses, sometimes there's a lot of sound effects thrown in that aren't just basses, sometimes there's all sorts of percussion, and sometimes it *is* just a kick, snare, sub, and midbasses.\n\nAlso, just because something doesn't have that many things going on at once doesn't mean it's \"musically simple\". Most of the interest in dubstep stuff comes from the rhythm and sound design of the midbasses, which can be pretty complex and change a lot. Less is more.",
        "If you\u2019re going to be reductive about it, yes that\u2019s mostly what they are. Having a sub bass and mid bass in your track simply corresponds to certain frequencies hitting the listeners ear (e.g. 30-80hz for sub), and obviously you want most of those frequencies if you want a full track.",
        "The way much EDM music is made is definitely done using a different approach to production and yes a lot more sound design and effects and noises are used. There are a few reasons for this but mostly:\n\n1. EDM tracks are more \"disposable then classical rock or even pop tracks so songwriting/composition (arguably the most difficult part to master) is less important.\n2. The vast majority of EDM is meant to be consumed in an \"altered state of consciousness\" which means clever sounds go much further.\n\nThat being said some of the best EDM tracks are made by guys that worked in rock music and took rock music composition and songwriting skills and applied them to dance music. (Chemical Brothers, anyone... They have 20+ year old tracks that are still enjoyable while I honestly could not tell you what was number 1 on Beatport in the last year.)",

You think about trying to keep the tonality when your sound design doesnt keep to a key, you will find that it is a case of meticulous orchestration and composition.\n\nTbh that is very much a Mr. Bill way of doing things. And i love mr bill but when ive done this myself ive found it to be a overly random composition. I like to have more of a musical concept behind the base of my tracks, it means that if my sound design isnt as good as i want it to be i still have the basis of a good piece of music.\n\nTheres a quote from someone that says \u201cif you can play your song on piano and it still sounds good, its a good song\u201d and i try and remind myself of that when im making stuff.",
        "It depends what genre of music you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019m gonna go ahead with dnb. Although, this is a really diverse genre. The key elements are the drums, bass, sub, and melody/mid bass or the thing that you recognise about a song. Other elements are key, but they only help to fill up space. I\u2019ve actually got a song upcoming where I fully improvise piano for the intro. The drop for that song was a melodic idea repeated and layered onto with terraced dynamics, being developed as time goes on. It was a rlly simple 4 bar melody loop involving moving down the f minor scale before jumping up a fifth (a rlly strong interval) and then going back down again to F. It\u2019s simple yet effective and I really liked it when I first made it. It was catchy, and I think that\u2019s the key thing of what makes an effective drop - it has to be simple yet effective. If you can\u2019t hum the tune after and immediatley forget it then it wasn\u2019t a good tune. Neurofunk, Riddim & dubstep work the same - they have simple ideas which can be remembered easily. Too simple and it\u2019s just every other riddim crochet rhythm, too complex and you\u2019ll be unable to sing it after.",

The producer uses sound design and modulation in lieu of chord progressions.  Filtering harmonics in and out almost tricks the ear into hearing chord changes.  Or at least staves off the aural boredom that would set in listening to one chord for 6 minutes.\n\nWatching tutorials online, I've seen producers use a very different approach to songwriting than I would have ever expected.  Mostly, they use the computer keyboard and mouse to draw in notes and chords, moving them around   (up and down octaves, cutting the audio clips differently, moving the notes left to right on a 16th note grid, etc)\n\nI've struggled for a couple of years to adopt these kinds of techniques (also while trying to absorb good mixing skills).  None of my tracks sounded like the styles I was going for.  I'm only now getting the hang of it.  I broke down and subscribed to paid tutorials based on a producer's youtube videos (Kimba Community).  His process finally made these impenetrable mixes make sense to me.\n\n I don't know if I'm following such a rigid formula that my next 5 tracks will sound like clones of the one I'm working on today, or if I just got lucky on this one and it actually kind of sounds like minimal house.  But I'm still having fun messing around with Ableton Live and its amazing array of tools.\n\nGood luck!",
        "It depends on the drop you want.\n\nIf you want a bass drop, then do what's said in your title.\n\nIf you want an EDM drop, then you take whatever lead you had before and give it a more 'powerful' sound. Add some chords, a bassline, and make your drums more complex. Make sure you fill most of the frequencies. (use a visual EQ to monitor the frequencies on your master track)\n\nIf you want a dubstep drop, then all you have to do is incorporate sound change over time. Manipulate wavetable positions using the LFO, change the volume, etc..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDrops are actually really easy to do if you understand how to make them.

        "Idk, is a rock chorus REALLY just a bass guitar, a drum set, and pieced together lead guitar/vocals?\n\nA drop is a high energy section of the music. If it sounds muddy it is because you have too many loud things going on in the same frequency range, usually the low mids. In a rock track, assuming your guitar and vocals are in the same octave, you can either have a loud and clear lead guitar, loud and clear vocals, or muddy and loud both. Or you can just take the vocals out of the same octave as the guitar and suddenly things start sounding clear again. Your brain doesn't like to try and decode a bunch of shit hanging out near each other in a pitch sense. It's just too much work and so individual elements lose clarity. This applies especially to bass sounds, that engage in lots of destructive interference with each other and eat up your headroom without sounding very loud (ever wonder why nobody has two bass guitar players? It's not only because they are all lazy shits that don't know how to play.)\n\nThe same thing applies to electronic music. Sometimes the kick IS the sub bass. If it isn't, then there is room for a real sub bass. Sometimes the midrange bass has a sub bass of it's own. Sometimes they are separate. In all cases, you NEVER have two sub basses unless you are using the phasing to create a volume oscillation pre distortion (a reese bass).\n\ntl:dr; just make something that sounds cool and if it is muddy then remove competing frequencies first in the composition, then in mixing and EQ.",
        "You did call it \"bass music\" though? It's, ya know, bass oriented. The majority of the masterpieces in production and design and the very best drops etc tend to have way more than just the bass and drums as the main instruments.

Keep in mind there's a difference between what you like to listen to and what you like to produce. I don't like listening to most of my own music, but others do and I absolutely love the process of making my music.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: After reading your edit I think even with the changed perspective on what I wrote it still counts just as well.

    "I don't know what strings to use.": [
        "Use a low or medium tension Classical Guitar string set. The guitar D is wound for your low G.\nStrings  D G B E, tune to g C E A. The same tuning and tension as capo 5 on a guitar. I did a bunch of research on various strings and their compatibility on the ukulele. Some are not suitable as the tension is too high/hard.\nI use Augustine Black Classical Guitar strings on my Tenor. They will work on concert and soprano as well. D'Addario actually repackage their classical strings as uke strings.",
        "> My strings sometimes sound different when playing the same not on different strings.\n\nThis is normal and probably not a result of the string type. Part of it is because the strings are different thicknesses, part of it is the timbre of the string is different because of the length of the vibrating section of the string. Typically, the frets 5-7 or so have a purer tone because of the over and under tones created when the string is vibrating at that length. When you play a note on an instrument, you aren't hearing *just* that note. You hear that note plus others that are related to it. Pure tones sound super dull to our ears, think of a computer making a tone.\n\nAs far as which strings to use, it sounds like you're sensitive to timbre and pitch like I am. On one of my ukuleles I am happy with the Fremont Blackline strings. On another, I prefer a mix of strings because I haven't found a set that I like for all four strings, the A will sound too pointy and sharp, or the C will be bleh, or some other thing I don't like. So I guess my suggestion would be to experiment with mixing sets, and think about and pay attention to how different string types affect the timbre of the pitch, bearing in mind what I mentioned above about the length of the vibrating string (the part between the fret you're holding and the bridge) also plays a big part.\n\nYou can find more information about these concepts by searching for \"timbre\" or \"tonal quality.\" There are some very interesting physics behind it.\n\nOh also, the ukulele scale and body size and all that play a factor too."

    "Popheads Album of the Year 2020 #36: Troye Sivan - In a Dream": [
        "Wow I really don\u2019t have a lot to add to this discussion other than Easy & In A Dream single-handily made this EP my 4th most listened to album of 2020. Absolutely love these songs...listened to the entire EP once when it first came out but I can\u2019t remember the rest of the songs much, I should revisit it.",
        "One thing I think is overlooked is STUD's references to Troye's body. I learned last year that he has a mild form of Marfan's, so when he's saying \"you got all the muscles and features I want,\" he's literally describing something he can never have.\n\nOverall, this is probably close to my favorite musical project of 2020. Bloom didn't really click with me until early 2020, but once it did, I was SO into it that I had no idea what to expect from Troye's next project. He by far exceeded my expectations and I can't wait to see what he does next. I think some people on this sub write him off as \"Spotify pop\" or as a pop boy whose only personality is being gay, but they're definitely missing out.",
        "I loved the Bloom album so much, but wasn't expecting a lot from this EP after I listened to the lead single Take Yourself Home which was just ok to me. But the rest of the EP is amazing, and Rager Teenager was one of my favourite tracks of the year - just a beautiful melody wrapped up in a dreamy soft pop track that i can just listen to again and again. Stud, Easy, 10/10, In A Dream were on repeat all year too.\n\nReally looking forward to what Troye does next. i think he's really underrated in the pop scene.",
        "I\u2019m really intrigued by the direction he\u2019s taking with the outro of Take Yourself Home and STUD",
        "According to my Last.fm stats, *In A Dream* was my 8th most played album of 2020 which is bonkers considering that it only has 5 real songs on it. There's a good chance that if it had been a full length album it would have been my most played of all. \n\nOver the summer at the peak of pandemic lockdown stress I had the chance to escape the city to an isolated cabin in the woods on top of a mountain. After a very paranoid 3 hour public transit trip from my house to the cabin I sat myself down outside, breathed in the fresh air, stared at the nature all around me, and blasted \"Take Yourself Home\" on repeat. Let me tell you that the lyric \"I\u2019m tired of the city, scream if you\u2019re with me / If I\u2019m gonna die, let\u2019s die somewhere pretty\" will never be more relatable to me than it was on that day. Easily my favourite song on the EP, and maybe even my favourite Troye song of all.\n\nMy least favourite has got to be \"10/10\" because it doesn't even sound like it should be part of *In A Dream* at all. It's a straightforward acoustic ballad in a sea of surprisingly bold and weird alt pop songs. It sounds more like an incomplete demo than the song that's literally just 50 seconds long. \n\nI'd hope that in the future he'd keep pursuing this musical direction, but I'm afraid he'll bounce back to pop stronger than ever after this. I'm kinda reminded of Kylie Minogue's *Impossible Princess* album where the songs were as close to alternative music as you could get while still being pop, and when it got a cold reaction from her audience she followed it up with the most mainstream sounding pop she'd made in a decade.",
        "I believe 10/10 was intended to just be a treat to those who own a physical copy of the EP, because I didn\u2019t know it existed until it played on my turntable for the first time. Similar to the demo of Seventeen that was hidden on Bloom\u2019s LP. But I quickly fell in love and was honestly a little sad it was put on streaming because it didn\u2019t feel like \u201cour little secret\u201d anymore LOL. So I think it was always intended for the track list and fits in really well, personally.\n\nBut aside from that, I really enjoyed this review in its attention to all the details: vocals, lyrics, instrumentation, and inspiration. Troye was a very integral part in my coming out and journey to self-acceptance, and this was released at a time where I still felt that I was growing up with him. So it\u2019s always nice to see when his music moves other people. I can only dream (pun intended) that his next full-length album rises to the occasion.",
        "His magnum opus. So excited to see what\u2019s next for him.",
        "Great analysis! I am still sore about the fact that Bloom was snubbed by all American music awards for some unknown reason. My introduction to this EP was with Easy which has grown on me slowly and now I feel every lyric of the track. However, for me Eager Teenager is MY track. The entire EP is so intimate and you feel what the artist is going through. I wish the Pop space hyped Troye more.",
        "Stellar write-up, OP! I've been a fan of Troye's for a long time and I always wanted him to make music like this. I hope his next record follows a similar indie-pop vibe.",
        "First of all, great write-up!\n\nSo yeah, this was by far my most listened EP/album in 2020. The months(!) I had it on literal repeat, resulted in my Spotify Wrapped 2020 looking like \n1. Easy\n2. Rager teenager!\n3. IN A DREAM\n4. STUD\n5. Take Yourself Home\n\nThis EP really feels like he picked out all the tracks I would love from a full-length album and put the 'fillers' away. And thanks to the sub 20 min format the incredibly high set bar can stay there all the way through. I hope that this way of releasing becomes even more prevalent in the future.\n\nThe strategy of, more or less, releasing every song as a single one by one is something that I rarely see work. But somehow each track was even better than the previous one. And I'm a big fan of keeping his own work light on features. One Ari per album is fine :)\n\nSo for the future I hope he follows the trajectory he is on. Releasing absolute bangers for his fanbase, some getting some brief spotlight on radio, continuing on the STUD/IAD/TYHoutro sound and being awesome on tiktok.\n\nSTUD was the best song released last year, so thanks Troye.",
        "I was kinda lukewarm about troye's previous projects but this EP really made a fan. Each track from the EP took turn being my favorite songs of the moment last year. I adore this record sonically and lyrically. Can't wait to see what he has in store for us!",

        "Incredible write up! \n\nI think you capture a lot of what makes the album so special. I really took to Easy, In A Dream and STUD when I first heard the EP, but I think the overall EP works fantastically well as a whole.\n\nThat being said, I feel like I moved on from it as I wasn\u2019t in a similar state of mind, until the Easy remix came out, and despite coming out towards the end of the year it became my most listened to song. Absolutely reinvigorated my love for the album, and I feel deserves more of a mention, but I realise not everybody took to the song like I did",
        "Loved this EP. I had a Take Yourself Home, Easy, STUD and IN A DREAM in my go-to playlists when they came out, then I kind of forgot about this EP with more music coming out (and when I took them out of my new music playlist), then re-discovered it looking at the list of upcoming album write-ups. \n\n1. Favourite tracks are the four I mentioned. Could cry is nice, but I'm not a big interlude person. I don't dislike Rager Teenager and 10/10, but they don't compare to the other other four for me. And I agree that 10/10 is kind of a different sound than the rest. \n2. It's probably my favourite thing he's done. Troye is someone whose stuff I like, but I don't necessarily listen to that often. But I just added those four tracks to my current Mood playlist. \n3. not sure\n4. I think I like him better without features. Not that I dislike the songs he's done with those people, but my faves are just him (well, I love HEAVEN, so not counting debut).",

So it's a freaking electric clavichord. \n\nYamaha CP80 was heard a lot through the 1980's on stage, when bands especially didn't want to have to lug around one or more grand pianos during concerts. Some U2 song uses one too, at least one...\n\nThe Fender Rhodes is heard on \"Just the Way you Are\" by William Martin Joel\nIt was also used extensively and still is, by those in the know, by Jazz artists, Jazz fusion.. and of course Pink Floyd post-Syd Barrett.

        "Lie is one of the best songs ever released. Period. \n\nAnd Jimin is the ONLY artist who could have pulled it off with that degree of mastery and genius in both lyricism, and performance.",
        "I have noticed your appreciation posts but always at times I was too much in haste to comment, so first of all, I want to tell you that you do such a brilliant job of delving into what makes the artist and/or the track so special. Love the positivity you spread, genuine effort you put and the thoughts you provoke with each of your posts. \n\nSecondly, I completely agree with your thoughts on Jimin, being a perfectionist and a captivating performer. He\u2019s ridiculously hard on himself, but each performance of his is so full of grace and for the lack of a better word...allure. It\u2019s the way that I can\u2019t take my eyes off him in Black Swan, or BS&T or Fake Love, and really so many MVs even though he\u2019s not my bias. He\u2019s an absolute pleasure to watch. He\u2019s someone I never get tired of watching either. \n\nLastly, I love Lie (although Serendipity is my favourite Jimin solo), it really is perfection.",
        "I wish I could frame your post and hang it on my wall and read it every morning. Thank you for this. <3 I especially love how you discussed your music. I wish you all the luck in the world for your musical endeavours! \n\nI got into BTS just last year. I saw several of those (inaccurate in their stereotyping, now I realise) \"who are the BTS members\" videos and Jimin caught my eye because I really truly thought he was the most beautiful man I had ever seen. I know now that he's not the visual, and his looks are in fact, considered 'flawed', but eh, the eye of the beholder and all that! I love his androgynous style and I am amazed by how his looks have evolved over the years, it's truly bold of him to have experimented so much and have come such a long way. \n\nHowever I digress from my main story... So I kinda sorta liked BTS, but i didn't really get into BTS till Lie happened to me. \n\nMy BTS obsession started with Lie. When I discovered that song, I listened to it over two hundred times in one month (or so Spotify tells me). Then I learnt the lyrics, sang it every day, found out everything to do with the song and also obsessively listened to Le Vida Breve by Manuel de Falla (the opening track of Lie is taken from this). Meanwhile, I discovered that not only is Lie Jimin's solo song, but he also has production credits for it (along with several other producers). I think this fact cemented my love for Jimin forever. \n\nI have never been obsessed about dance before but here I was, watching these two Jimin vids \u2014 [the Lie solo for the Wings Short film ](https://youtu.be/IUhmH7Qqkso) and [his Black Swan solo Bangtan Bomb](https://youtu.be/xMfp2jcK52M) \u2014 nearly every day because I found comfort and inspiration in them. \n\nI have since then really gone deep into BTS and have found several wonderful favourites from all the members. I really love them all so much and they have brought me so much joy and comfort in the shittiest year of my life. \n\nAnd while I find them all amazing and massively appreciate all of them, Jimin will always remain special.  I hope I'll be able to watch them live one day. Fingers crossed!",
        "Firstly, it feels like I ghost wrote this post. But at the same time not because it's so well written and every time I try to explain the artist that is Jimin, I fumble up my words. So I'm just going to link this [stage mix](https://youtu.be/Li1tqnc1N90) of Lie that I have watched more times than I can admit. It's strange how Jimin is able to make me feel like I'm living the song through him and its anguish when I watch Lie, feel comfort and loved when I watch Serendipity, and just hot and bothered when I see Filter. He really is a chameleon who lives and breathes for the stage and it shows with everything he does. There is nothing about him on stage that feels contrived. He just lets his emotions speak and take him where they want him to go. Each Lie stage feels different in that way. Also him doing [the dance ](https://youtu.be/IUhmH7Qqkso) off stage. It honestly makes me uneasy but in the best way because that's what good art does. You can't listen to Schumann's Winterreise and feel at ease. \n\nAlso I love how you speak from your own experience as a violinist about hating your craft and simultaneously loving your craft. I relate as a classical singer. And I see a lot of myself in Jimin and perhaps that's one of the reasons he is my ult.",
        " This is a really well written post. I found it interesting when you delved into lie cos it's always Lie isn't it? Everything about that song is such a masterpiece, and it ages like fine wine, 5 years later and listening to it is still such a pleasure. And when Jimin performed it? Wow, suffice it to say, no one comes close in delivering the same raw emotions as Jimin does while performing this song. I never get tired of watching the stage, or enjoying other watch the stage of lie and gush about it, because they almost always have something to point out or to say about the performance. I especially remember one of my favorite YouTube reactor ecstatically point out what he called a [\"James Brown moment\"](https://youtu.be/nr5qY7xjs3U?t=323) Jimin portrayed while performing Lie. He described it as that moment towards the end of a stupendous performance, the crowd is just going crazy, with the artist seemingly drained and exhausted, before he suddenly gets a burst of energy and finishes off the performance with a bang. I didn't even know it was a thing.  \n\n\nI will keep saying this, you can teach someone to dance, and the person could get all the techniques right down to the T, but you see musicality? delivering/embodying the feel and emotion of the song accurately in a performance, making others feel what you feel while performing a song, it's a gift that Jimin has. That's why when I say he is one of the best performers I have ever seen, I mean every. single. word.",
        "First I just want to say that this is really beautifully written and I agree with everything you've said!\n\nJimin's dance was the very first thing that won me over when I first discovered bts. One of my favourite things about his performances is that he seems to have an inate ability to understand his dance lines that goes beyond what endless practise can achieve. \n\nEvery single line he creates is beautiful. \n\nHe applies disciplines he would have learnt in high school to idol dance. For example he lengthens his spine, keeps his chest open and his shoulders down. It's immediately eye catching because its so aesthetically pleasing. And I think it's easy to assume that the reason why jimin's dance is so popular is because\u00a0he's a beautiful person with a beautiful athletic body. But it's doesnt work like that, for one jimin's athletic body is a product of his dance, and for two no matter how beautiful your body is, if you don't extend, if you allow your shoulders to bunch up or if you're lazy even for a moment your dance is not going to be beautiful. It's because jimin understands how to place and angle every limb and every joint of his body so that in each moment of his dance he's creating the most beautiful lines possible that makes him so mesmerising to watch.\u00a0\n\nWhich randomly reminded me of a moment I just want to relive - when Matthew Bourne (the most successful and most popular choreographer in the UK, who's famous for his swan lake interpretation with all male swans) [retweeted jimin's dance with a heart emoji](https://twitter.com/SirMattBourne/status/1288061341689876480?s=19). It was a very special moment for me as a i grew up doing ballet and watching his shows and he is someone I admire a lot. So for him to notice and recognise jimin's dance? It's huge and awesome and probably inconsequential if you've never heard of him lol but it was amazing for me that someone of such incredible calibre who I've been a fan of for so long can see in jimin all the things that I see too!",
        "Lie will always be one of the best solo songs that BTS has released. It aged so well. Jimin's isolation, muscle control and popping (I believe that he is technically the best in these three in the group) is off the charts and it always baffles me how it's barely mentioned and how fans calls him only a contemporary dancer. Do you think someone who was only trained in contemporary could do [this](https://youtu.be/tEVSZV1FqNQ) and Lie, which was far from contemporary (idk why ARMYs still classify Lie as contemporary)? The video was posted almost five years ago. If he was this good then, how good is he now? His skills are criminally underestimated and underappreciated in the fandom (thank God for the professional dancers that acclaim his skills) and you have to dig deep in YouTube just to find videos of him dancing to styles that aren't contemporary.",
        "This is such an insightful, peotic and intriguing post - even though I had to chuckle for a second at the \" dangerous butterfly\" comparison. I especially liked how you drew the artist's passion from your experience. 2020 killed much of my own passion, so I'm even more curious how Jimin in particular will translate this experience into performances and music. \"Lie\" (song and performance) was what made me a fan of BTS and Jimin; \"Filter\", with its darker meaning and breathtaking performance might have been my favorite song of last year (together with Blackswan, Shadow: Interlude and Dis/ease), so Im looking forward to whats to come.",
        "you put into words everything i have felt ever since i discovered jimin randomly from a yt video on a cold night nearly 7 yrs ago...i've seen & experienced every single one of those emotions along with him over the years...\n\nJimin is truly once in a lifetime or generation kind of artist...he truly achieved what he set out to do years ago; moving ppl with his voice and songs and dance and getting the world to fall in love him...forever grateful for that serendipituous moment of youtube recommendation & cant wait for what jimin has in store for us in the future...knowing him & his drive & his personality, it's gonna be more & more amazingness to come for sure...thanks for your wonderful post...",
        "What a lovely post, I found your butterfly analogy interesting, I wonder why you picked that. \n\nYou said it all basically. Jimin is an all round performer. Describing his artistic prowess is not so easy to do, because he has multiple facets as a performer which are all still essentially him. Watching him do what he obviously loves doing is such a blessing and I hope he can keep at this for a long time. \n\nIt's clear that Jimin is born for the stage, and saying he stands out in every single performance is an understatement.\u00a0 Be it with his amazing unique and versatile voice, his graceful dance style, his ethereal looks, he always embodies the performance and glows on stage. He really understands what it means to embody and deliver the essence of a song.\n\nOne of my favorite things to watch is Jimin's expressions while dancing. His dancing is already very expressive, so he often goes for a \"neutral\" expression, or is it? Because I could swear those eyes are always brimming with emotion, and that's exactly it! His eyes really draws you in as he immerses himself in the performance, and once in a while, he lets out a well placed smile, or a hint of an expression here and there. And this change is quite subtle yet effective because it essentially means the audience keeps their eyes glued to him to catch these moments, making for a very cathartic experience. I genuinely feel he is a once in a life time performer.",
        ">Yuzuru Hanyu, two-time Olympic champion, one of the greatest figure skaters ever, once said, \"Artistry is founded upon absolute technical prowess.\" And I'd believe this is applicable to dance as well.\n\nI agree and to take this further, Jimin combines technical prowess (strength, flexibility, perfect lines, form etc) and genuine natural expressions for an engaging and mesmerizing dancing. He is expressive, intense, graceful and moving, making him stand out in every single performance.\n\nHe adequately embodies emotions in his performance such that it seeps even into things that are more physical such as posture, coordination and even his walk. This is really what makes him different, and it comes naturally to him. He is naturally intuitive and inclined towards emotional authenticity, but through hardwork he keeps honing and perfecting this talent even more. A stand out artist through and through.",
        ">Jimin lives and breathes performing. When he's on stage, he's one with the music. He melds with his stage persona, and he fully embraces it. He is daring and charismatic and stealthy and captivating and we cannot help but just watch in amazement. He knows he has the IT factor.\n\nExactly this! He has the IT factor, you can't explain it. He's just IT.\n\nEdit: I just finished going through this [blog](https://finch-and-jay.tumblr.com/post/177762371108/the-best-dancer-debate-j-hope-vs-jimin) and wow, thank you so much for sharing. It was really informative.",
        ">Jimin has an extremely distinct style - his posture is beautiful, relaxed and laid back shoulders accentuating his lines, he floats and glides across the stage effortlessly. His musicality is so moving; he utilises rubato so effectively to highlight specific notes but he is never offbeat. Every single dance move is so well thought out, from the deeper bend of his knee to the flick of his pinky. His dancing is striking, arresting, mesmerising. Everything is on purpose but seems so effortless, the true trademark of an artist. It could be his silhouette dancing and we would know. \n\n\nWow, I'm not even surprised, something about the man really makes one wax lyricals about him. Brilliant write up.\n\n>Not to mention he is so underappreciated in his music creation - look to the bridge of Dis-ease and Lie and the melody of Blood Sweat and Tears, amongst multiple other songs. These songs age like wine, and I will never get tired of them. Every single aspect shows he is such a versatile artist, driving himself to constantly improve, moulding himself into his ideal artistic image. \n\nThis deserves to be highlighted and I most definitely agree.",
        "I just want to say that this was a lovely write up and appreciation post for Jimin, and a wonderful analysis of Lie.",
        "On a side note, Armys really went crazy with the awards. This post deserves it though.",
        "an appreciation post for jimin *and* an analysis of lie? i wish i could give you a million awards, op. your write-up is wonderful.\n\ni think jimin is my favourite performer ever. for me, he is the embodiment of musicality, passion & a level of skill that, although based on raw talent, can only be refined with a century's worth of blood, sweat & tears. jimin consistently blows me away on stage & behind the scenes. his work ethic is great & he is a beautiful person inside & out. to call my love & admiration for jimin \"celebrity worship\" does both of us a disservice. i don't even like stan culture (before bts, i wasn't interested in *any* celebrity) & i like to think that the respect jimin demands goes beyond that. yeah, he is an insanely popular idol & that comes with its own share of parasocial relationships & hive-minds, but he is genuinely so incredible, there is no reason why he *shouldn't* be adored to this extent.\n\nreally, i feel this way about every member of bts, but since this post is about jimin, i'll focus on him: i don't understand how one person can be this great, on so many fronts. like, i'll watch a fancam of lie & i'll be overwhelmed by how great of a dancer jimin is, to the point where i forget about every other quality that he has. and then, i'll watch one of his lives & i'll be so caught up in his loveliness & sincerity that i'll forget he is an extremely talented artist in the mega-successful group bts. it's like my brain can't process too many good things at once. in other words, jimin makes my brain go error 404 not found.",

Voc\u00ea provavelmente vai gostar bastante da m\u00fasica que da nome ao \u00e1lbum, Evermore, outra parceria da Taylor com a Bon Iver.\n\n**3\u00b0- Red:** O \u00e1lbum onde a parada come\u00e7ou a ficar bom pra mim, diversas m\u00fasicas que gostei como Stay Stay Stay, a famosa We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together, al\u00e9m das que voc\u00ea citou como as que voc\u00ea mais gostou.\n\nSe fosse aumentar pra um top 5 eu acrescentaria o Folklore e o Reputation, mas como em geral eu prefiro as m\u00fasicas mais animadas eles acabaram ficando fora do meu top 3 apesar de terem sido os seus dois favoritos.\n\nSobre o Lover tenho que concordar, que caralhos foi isso Taylor Swift...\n\nEm geral a experi\u00eancia foi boa, vou ter que adicionar umas m\u00fasicas dela em algumas playlists minhas aqui kkkk",

(Inclusive na Netflix tbm tem o show Reputation, mas eu n\u00e3o sou muito f\u00e3). \n\nE se tiver mais saco ainda, mas aqui seria meu conte\u00fado favorito: o show Speak Now World Tour vai te surpreender pelo n\u00edvel alt\u00edssimo de espet\u00e1culo e entretenimento variado. Ele tem uma mescla de m\u00fasicas do \u00e1lbum Speak Now e dos dois anteriores. \nNesse show (que vc s\u00f3 vai conseguir por meios ilegais) vc vai ver qu\u00e3o talentosa ela \u00e9, tocando guitarra, viol\u00e3o, banjo, ukelele e piano, al\u00e9m claro e principalmente o desempenho vocal. Inclusive foi assistindo esse show que comecei a curtir ela. \n\nParab\u00e9ns pela an\u00e1lise dos \u00e1lbuns, foi surpreendente seus relatos e descri\u00e7\u00f5es!",
        "Como swiftie desde antes de Red, venho trazer algumas informa\u00e7\u00f5es, focando nas m\u00fasicas que voc\u00ea citou em \"gostei/n\u00e3o-gostei\":\n\nTaylor Swift (2006) - aqui a grande faixa que puxou ela para se tornar famosinha foi Tim McGraw.\n\nEu sinceramente gosto de TODAS desse \u00e1lbum, mas ela n\u00e3o tinha praticamente fama ent\u00e3o n\u00e3o h\u00e1 muito o que comentar.\n\nFearless (2008) - Aqui o grande single foi Fifteen e Love Story, Love Story tornou ela realmente GRANDE, tocava na \"mtv\" e afins TODA HORA, as meninas pr\u00e9-adolescentes se apaixonaram total. O clipe de Fifteen \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m muito tocante e com a experi\u00eancia unida desses dois videoclipes ela come\u00e7ou a ter uma verdadeira FANDOM e lotar shows.\n\nChange foi a primeira m\u00fasica dela com uma mensagem pol\u00edtica. Change e White Horse foram singles e possuem videoclipes. Muitos swifties mais atuais sequer conhecem \"Breathe\", \u00e9 uma das m\u00fasicas menos conhecidas da discografia oficial dela. \n\nSpeak Now (2010) - Pra entender essa era, \u00e9 preciso ver os visuais, do \u00e1lbum, dos clipes e dos shows. Foi o momento que deu pra perceber que est\u00e1vamos lidando com uma ARTISTA e que ia se manter na m\u00eddia por um longo tempo, e n\u00e3o apenas uma \u00eddolo teen que vai e vem. \"Long Live\" foi escrita para os f\u00e3s, homenageando o sucesso da turn\u00ea Fearless. Speak Now fez bastante sucesso ainda com o mesmo p\u00fablico teen das eras anteriores. Enchanted \u00e9 uma das mais valorizadas pelos swifities de longa data, \u00e9 uma daquelas m\u00fasicas que nunca cansam. Com a m\u00fasica Mean ela sofreu seu primeiro \"quase-cancelamento\", pois ela pega pesado com um cr\u00edtico que deu review baixo para o primeiro \u00e1lbum dela.\n\nRed (2012) - Aqui a ind\u00fastria j\u00e1 entendia o potencial dela e o maior produtor musical da \u00e9poca passou a trabalhar com ela. O visual muda de vestidos que eram cada vez maiores, para, sinceramente: \"o visual da era Red\". Marcou \u00e9poca, influenciou a moda mundialmente, e a Taylor se tornou uma ARTISTA POP e n\u00e3o apenas uma \u00eddolo teen. Pessoas que nunca ouviram falar dela, agora cantarolavam as suas can\u00e7\u00f5es, que tocavam em toda e qualquer r\u00e1dio de atualidades. Foi um momento incr\u00edvel para os swifties, vendo a sua menina country dos clipes de princesa se tornando um staple da cultura musical para todas as idades. \n\nOs maiores singles foram as m\u00fasicas mais gen\u00e9ricas e upbeat: 22 e We Are Never Getting Back Together | al\u00e9m de I Knew You Were Trouble, que como voc\u00ea avalia, \u00e9 uma experi\u00eancia audit\u00f3ria \u00fanica. Uma m\u00fasica que \u00e9 universalmente aclamada pelos swifities at\u00e9 hoje, e que parece n\u00e3o ter tocado no seu radar, \u00e9 All Too Well.\n\nOs outros \u00e1lbuns s\u00e3o muito recentes e eu como historiadora-swiftie me abstenho de evocar opini\u00f5es at\u00e9 um consenso se formar.",

    "Relationship between instrument/scales and emotions/themes": [
        "There are many different things, but mostly it's about the instruments used.  \n\nE.g., for \"space/cosmic/alien\" the classic instrument is the theremin.  Now synths (of course) can create similar \"other-worldly\" sounds - i.e. sounds that are clearly not possible with any conventional \"earthly\" instrument (i.e., the familiar string, wind, and percussion instruments).\n\nFor \"Hawaii\", a ukulele or slide guitar is the convention.  (Slide guitar was originally called \"Hawaiian\" guitar, back in the early 20thC.)  \n\nOrgan, obviously - especially a large pipe organ with plenty of reverb! - will connote \"church\".  \n\nOther ethnic sounds will likewise be expressed using the instruments of that culture (e.g., koto for Japan, sitar for India, mizmar for Arabia, bouzouki for Greece, tin whistle for Ireland, bagpipes for Scotland...).   Obviously this is shorthand effects for western audiences.   \n\nThe scales used could be normal western major and minor scales; the instrument(s) used is usually enough to connote the culture one is trying to evoke.  Naturally, for more convincing evocations, an appropriate \"ethnic\" scale could be used - such as the double harmonic scale for \"arabic\".   \nWhere the instrument of the culture is a familiar western instrument already - such as the guitar in Spain - then musical factors (in that case phrygian dominant and ornamentation) become more important.  \n\nOther non-instrumental musical factors - at least as important as scales - are rhythms and timbres.  Complex rhythms and fast tempos, for example, can easily denote something Arabic or Eastern European (which is which would be  determined by the instruments chosen - eg fiddles and accordions, probably, for the latter, or maybe something more specific like a cimbalom).\n\nAgain, when it comes to mood and emotion, it's rhythm, tempo, dynamics, timbre and so on that do the work, much more than scales, modes or chords.   Harmony does matter, but mostly in terms of a basic consonance-dissonance spectrum, rather than anything more complex theoretically.  (Dissonance obviously connotes tension - fear, danger, horror, etc.)\n\nYou could use this list to begin to compile your own!  I'm not aware of an existing chart of such things, although I wouldn't be surprised if film composers and arrangers know of some.  Obviously such a chart would be handy for video game composers.",
        "These associations are largely from earlier cultural tropes, rather than any theoretical connection. You can often point to the particular soundtrack that kicked it off, but then hundreds of future soundtracks reinforce the connection by imitation. Like for horror, that connection is from the silent film era (Toccata and Fugue in Dm being a standard part of organist repertoire), then featuring in several early horror movies like Jekyll and Hyde. Eventually, all you need to do is play a Baroque fugue or dance in a castle scene (say, Wood Carving Partita in Castlevania SotN) and people will get a vampire vibe, even if they can't say why. \n\nSpace/cosmic themes tend to use a lot of fourths and quartal harmony.  I also associate the whole tone scale with 70s/80s space/sci-fi; don't know if that association holds true for others too.\n\nIf you want to emulate energetic, early platformer music, use stride left hand, general ragtime tropes, and a lot of chromaticism. \n\nAs mentioned, vampiric horror draws a lot from Baroque music. That's a natural fit for videogame music too, since it fits well within the constraints of old sound chips (like only having one note per channel). (Not that modern videogame music has that constraint, but it's part of the genre now.)\n\nI assume you follow 8-bit Music Theory on YouTube, but if not, definitely do. He's got some great breakdowns of distinctive genres/styles, like what ingredients come together to make Castlevania music distinctive.",
        "People have already explained it really well with good examples, so I'll give a slightly more technical explanation. I'd just like to note that I am by no means an expert, I'm going off my experience as a musician and what I've learned from piano theory and AP Music Theory.\n\n**TL;DR:** There are two main factors in giving a certain feel to music - instrumentation, that is, the timbres used, and composition, particularly the keys and chords used as a base to the music.\n\nTimbre - AKA what makes an instrument sound like itself - is defined as \"the character or quality of a musical sound or voice as distinct from its pitch and intensity\". When you hear loud trumpets playing a fanfare, you know it's a trumpet because it's timbre is distinct from any other instrument. Of course, timbre can vary in each instrument, depending on who's playing it, the setup and model of the instrument, and other factors (bright and warm are often descriptors of timbre as well). Now that I've gone off an a tangent, basically timbre is  a large influence on what you think of when you hear certain music.\n\nTo give you a more specific example, sticking with trumpets - I would say trumpets normally have a bright, brassy timbre, though it can often warm up in the lower registers. Brass instruments are unique in that they have mutes, which can change the timbre with. For example, a straight mute gives an even brighter and tinny sound, while a cup mute usually rounds out the sound more and warms it slightly.\n\nThe second factor is the composition of the music itself. Good composers can write in any key and evoke a certain feeling, however most people generally go to different keys for different feels. Major keys generally feel happy, while minor keys and chords generally feel sad and dreary (I did my 5th grade science project on this!). I've included some charts at the bottom as well to give you an idea of keys and modes and the feelings they evoke.\n\nChords also have a large impact. Minor chords again evoke a sad and depressed feeling, while diminished chords often bring a sense of tension, wrongness, and other negative feelings. There's a lot about chords that I won't get into though.\n\nBoth these charts are subjective but can give a good start:\n\n[Key feeling chart](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/500392208587589805/?d=t&mt=login)\n\n[Mode feeling chart](https://blog.flat.io/choosing-the-key/) \\- scroll to about the middle to find it, ignore the notes they provide",

While I don't know airwindows (and I think those modeling plugins are useless; you're better off learning your actual system) it suggests your left and right channels may be interfering with each other constructively.\n\nNoone cares about audio quality in social media and neither should you. Vk or otherwise. Most tiktoks sound like ass, on good setups. Social media targets phone listeners, who won't be able to tell the difference.\n\nIf you really want more loudness, just slap a limiter at the end of your master and crank it. If you're reasonable, get it sounding the best it can and stop wasting your time worrying about it.",

Closer to zero is louder.\n\nI can also hear from the clip that your track sounds louder than the reference.\n\nRight now, the mix is off to my ears. The drums and guitars seem be to be floating in different spaces and the rhythm guitars are way too loud and muddy. I would first try to get the drums, bass, and rhythm guitar to glue together before worrying about loudness.\n\nI would recommend bringing all the faders down and try to rebalance the tracks starting with the drums and then rhythm guitars/bass.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions. I would be glad to answer!",

Standards that would have discouraged mix squashing.\n\nRead up on the controversy around Metallica's \"Death Magnetic.\" You don't want to do that to your music.\n\nBe brave.

        "It's not suprising that a $1500 pair of totl headphone sounds better overall than one that came out in 1997..Even earlier if you count the 580. I still couldn't justify the price, maybe when the money is less tight lol",
        "Nice write up! Your conclusion regarding the amp doesn\u2019t surprise me much. I find that the headphones generally tend to make a far more substantial difference in sound than the amp and DAC do, at least to a certain degree. I\u2019ve never heard the JDS stack you have but from what I\u2019ve read it seems highly competent and will serve both of those headphones well. \n\nI am someone who found the Clear to have a slightly metallic or dry sound to it in the treble region. I\u2019m not sure why, but that\u2019s just how I remember them sounding to my ear. I\u2019d love to try them again some day to see if I still feel that way.\n\nI had similar concluding thoughts as you did when I owned a pair of Clears and HD 660s: Clears were definitely better, but the 660s were crazy good and very competitive for a bit less than half the price. However, this (combined with essentially everything you said regarding repairability) drove me to sell the Clears and find something a bit different to compliment the 660s. I agree completely with your overall conclusion - the HD 600 series headphones are incredibly solid and hold their ground even against much more expensive headphones.",
        "The Clear has an agreeable tonality with good technicalities overall so I find your impressions similar to mine. I also wasn't much into EQ when I had them so I never got to really try them with an EQ profile. That said, I don't think they're worth the $1k price tag overall if you're one to use EQ. I'm probably among the few that downgraded from the Clear because I started finding EQ as a useful tool.\n\nAnyways, great to hear you find the Clear enjoyable! Make sure to get a headband cover cause those stain fast.",
        "Nice writeup. I have the HD 600 after trying out a lot of headphones; Aeon Flow, hd 6xx, hd 58x, lcd-2c. Hd 600 was my favourite of the bunch. I'm considering an upgrade to a ZMF Aeolus or Focal Clear. But I think I'm going to enjoy my HD 600 for awhile before I do.",
        "I've had my hd600s for 20 years ;-)\n\nJust replaced the earpads, cable and band sponge once.\n\nEvery now and then I think about upgrading but reckon I'd probably be underwhelmed.",
        "Just a small correction, hd6-- pads are $45-50 for real OEM replacements. Still much easier to swallow than $200 for the clear. Any aftermarket solution will probably change the sound still I would imagine. Not saying people can't try it, I can't say what they'll actually do from personal experience  as I haven't changed the pads from OEM, but pads are quite a big part of tuning, so it makes sense that any deviation from stock will be noticeable. Interesting that you didn't have the same timbral issues as some people have switching from something like a 600, I guess that's a good thing for you that you don't notice it! I find myself a bit susceptible to timbre so far with the small amount of things I've tried next to my 600s.",
        "My Micca Origen+ kicked the bucket a while back after years of use, and I bought the Monolith as well after seeing some videos on it. I agree, I'm kinda meh about it compaired to my old Micca. I don't notice much difference at all with my 650's and the Micca is like 1/4 of the price. Diminishing returns definitely exist.\n\nToo late for me to return it and get something cheaper, so I'll stick with it. It looks really nice, so that's something",
        "Should have went for a Schiit Modius+Magnius stack for $400 instead of the Monolith. You do get much more power running balanced instead of single ended and a lower noise floor which can be useful for sensitive IEMs."

        "I think some discussion on surround sound is needed too.\n\n\nSo you want to run your PC in surround sound? You have 2 options, analog multichannel or digital spdif \n\n\nThe traditional way to get PC surround sound is with the analog 3.5mm multi outs on the back of the PC. Green for the front left and right, orange for subwoofer and center, and black for rear left and right. This allows you to decode any surround sound audio in software and then send it to the corresponding channels on the amp. However, this can allow noise and ground loops into the signal.\n\n\nThe other way is to use digital. There are 2 main connectors for consumer digital audio, coaxial and toslink. Coax uses a traditional electral connection to send digital data. Toslink works using fiber optics to transmit the signal. Due to the nature of Toslink it can eliminate noise from ground loops and interference, a big bonus.\n\n\nHowever, managing PC surround sound over digital interfaces can be complicated. \n\nThe biggest problems come from the protocols used for the audio. The vast majority of audio comes through as 2 channel pcm audio. This is clean uncompressed digital sound, most games and videos and music will go to the amp as this.\n\n\nWhen you watch a movie with a Dolby Digital or DTS soundtrack however, the video player software takes the audio track and streams it straight to your amp/receiver for decoding, known as bitstreaming. The downside is that if you are playing back any bitstream audio you can't play back anything else without ending the stream, aka outright stopping the movie\n\nThe other downside to this is that the content you're enjoying has to already encode it's audio as DTS or Dolby Digital for you to enjoy surround sound. Most games don't do this and it would be awfully slow to do in a real time manner using software.\n\nIf you want surround sound in games while using a digital audio connection, you need a sound card that supports either Dolby Digital Live or DTS Connect. These are hardware chips that do real time encoding of audio leaving your pc so that your amp can output games in surround sound.",

        "Needs a tl;dr, longest post I\u2019ve ever seen",
        "I do want to add one thing: if you're going for Bluetooth headphones because you want a more general-purpose set that you can also wire-in to your computer, pay attention to the codec it uses, especially if you have an Android phone (Apple's special codec, AAC, is fairly widely supported for their devices & is still better than the default SBC everyone has to support). Check what your phone supports, and check for headphones that support those. *Battery life should always be a consideration because you'll have these for a while*\n\nAptX-HD is pretty much the best you'll get beyond LDAC, but LDAC is Sony-only right now so unless you're getting Sony cans you'll want HD if possible. Regular AptX is still a vast improvement over SBC, and because it's a bit older is going to have a bit more support.\n\nAptX-LL stands for low-latency, which pretty much requires a dedicated transmitter since nothing has it built-in. Not common in headphones, but if you want that 2.4Ghz wireless almost no audio lag but for Bluetooth, you'll want LL. Sound quality takes a nosedive to push data faster though, so it's a tradeoff.\n\nThere's also AptX-Adaptive, which is really new & not super well supported by headphones yet. This is the closest to how LDAC works in that LDAC is adaptive to your connection quality - more stable connection, higher quality audio. Weaker connection, lower quality. Both are improvements over SBC, which isn't great and is likely what you'll be getting out of a standard Bluetooth adapter for your PC (Windows, as far as I know, doesn't support AptX or LDAC natively, but let's be real just wire your headphones in).\n\nYou 100% pay a premium for good headphones with Bluetooth support, but there are cans that are the same but just have BT built-in (The Audio-Technica MX50 has a BT version, the sound quality takes a dip because Bluetooth is just Like That, but the cans are otherwise just like normal MX50's), but what you pay isn't always what you'll get in the BT world because it hinges on code. You could run bomb Sennheisers over Bluetooth but if your codec is trash so will the audio. I'll admit my headphones (Cleer Enduro 100) probably fall into the \"they're good enough for me\" category, but they're still a huge improvement over shitty $20 Logitech speakers or $50 true wireless earbuds. I use these headphones pretty much constantly now, wired or wireless, and rarely use my speakers because they're just...bad.",

Why would you blow money on a speaker and amp setup and not use a decent interface? The sound difference when I use my cheapo lexicon interface is huge. Fuckin huge. It's usb so I'll bring it to friends places and the difference is always huge. Especially if they have decent amp/speakers. I only have experience with recording interfaces and hi fi though (mostly sonar, bit of cubase back when), I haven't played games in years. I use a stereo setup for everything. Also sennheisers. There's four sets of 4.40s in our house now I've infected my spawn with the audio bug. Glad to see a mention. Brilliant kit.\n\nEdit : you really need to get something about the source audio interface. Before you blow 400 credits on speakers you really need a decent audio interface.

        "A couple things that should be mentioned to add on:\n\n*  Avoid anything that says \"audiophile\" on it. You're just paying a premium for no reason. Are they good products? Probably, but your money will go farther looking for entry level \"pro-audio\" products. The ubiquity of home recording enthusiasts means that high quality sound reproduction has become pretty affordable.\n* OP mentioned this, but avoid \"gaming\" as well. You're paying for style on shitty plastic components.\n*  Sweetwater, Musician's Friend, and even Guitar Center will have everything you need to get a great setup.\n* A good Digital Audio Converter (DAC), also known as an audio interface, should not be overlooked. This is the piece of hardware that converts 1s and 0s into variable voltage that speakers and headphones use to generate sound. They will allow for cleaner, less noisy audio with less distortion than your motherboard's built-in DAC. As a bonus, they usually have a built in high quality headphone amp, speaker volume control, and mic inputs that can be used for in-game chat or discord, or record your own music if you're so inclined. \n\nA few brand recommendations: \n\n* Focusrite: Audio interfaces\n* Apogee: Audio interfaces and usb mics\n* Blue: Microphones, of the usb and analog varieties\n* Audio Technica: Headphones, analog mics.\n* Sennheiser: Headphones, also makes mics but they're expensive. \n\n\nSource: I'm a professional audio engineer.",

        ">So great speakers and headphones can literally make you FEEL the music like at a rave or a concert or performance in the comfort of your home.\n\nDepending on where and how you live, your neighbors may FEEL that with you, at least if you go for a good speaker and subwoofer setup.   \n\nSo if headphones remain the only viable alternative, there's still a way to actually feel the music called [Subpac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xw09UUoEETM).

Speaker are a pair of KRK VXL 4 active bi-amp studio monitors paired with a KRK S8 sub. Lots of folks say that non-HiFi speakers are ill-suited for critical listening. I really don't agree at all. These KRKs are by no means the highest quality studio monitor out there, but they're super-detailed and I enjoy that. All the stuff I got was used and I do recommend that approach.\n\nIn the realm of passive speakers, I'm a Micca Fanboy and cannot recommend bookshelf MB42X speakers enough. They're cheap but well-made and sound phenomenal for their size. If you're looking for PC speakers, these are excellent. Pair 'em with small DAC/AMP and you're good to go. Topping MX3 gets good reviews and I loved my SMSL AD18 when I had it.\n\nSpeaker placement is in fact key and is regularly ignored. Get 'em up and off the deck, as close to ear height as possible. Isolation pads are not required, but can't hurt. Toe the speakers in a bit, towards you. They should be placed on either side of your monitor. Obviously dual monitors make things awkward.\n\nQuality computer audio components can be a solid investment that travels from system to system.

        "I am a professional sound designer, sound mixer, system designer, and there are fundamental flaws in this post. \"Obviously the mb42x will sound marginally better purely from the virtue that the amplifier you buy will be better than the shitty one in the pb42x.\" Not true. The manufacturer has picked the amplifier inside to precisely match the power requirements of the speaker. It won't sound any worse or better than the passive speaker. \"Note: you may experience a hissing with active speakers that may annoy you to no end even up to the $400 mark. This is a result of the amplifier being built in to the speaker in close proximity, as well as sometimes the manufacturer cutting corners elsewhere.\" All audio systems will induce noise and an active speaker won't have any more noise than a passive speaker if you have proper gain staging. If either of those two statements were true, then recording studios all over the world wouldn't be using active studio monitors as the majority of their reference system, and big loudspeaker manufacturers like Meyer wouldn't be making their flagship boxes like the Meyer X-40 as active boxes. \"bigger woofer size does *not* necessarily indicate better quality/bass.\" Again not true. 5\" woofers simply won't be able to produce the sub frequencies a 7\" or larger woofers can. That's physics. \"You want to look at the subwoofer's lowest frequency it can go to. That will show you how \"tight\" the bass will be.\" Again not true. The listed rating is complete bogus. You don't know how they tested, what they used to measure that speaker, other components used in that measurement system and just because sub A goes down to 35 and sub B only goes to 50 doesn't mean sub A will produce a tighter bass response than sub B. \"Now, low volume levels on a good sub will produce that bass for you without vibrating your walls (though subwoofer and speaker isolation.\" Not true. If the sub can pass the sound to you through the floor, it'll still pass the sound through the walls it is in close proximity to. It may not be enough to register a noise complaint but if you're feeling the bass, so is the floor and the walls around it. \"BeyerDynamic DT770 (32, 90, 250 ohms)\" They actually come in an 80 ohm version and \"The higher ohm versions require separate headphone amp.\" no not unless you get the 250 ohm version.

        "I love my ath-m50x's personally. It's a huge leap to those from shitty razer headsets though... I mostly use my PC to listen to music and make music though so it's a must to have high quality audio. One thing I would note is the ath-m50x's aren't necessarily more bass heavy, but have a V shape bias, as in the highs and lows will be exaggerated. I use them to mix music and I always have to use multiple pairs of headphones and speakers to make sure it sounds good. I am guessing for the audience this is meant for though, heavy bass is not by any means muddy or overpowered on them and much lighter than headphones advertised as bass boost headphones.\n\nThe ATH-MXXx line is made for studio use not necessarily gaming so they naturally will be made to be flatter than normal headphones for \"gaming\" or listening. I will say they are 100x better though. I have went through a pair of m20x, m40x, and m50x and the 50x is my choice personally. I will say the m20x I would recommend buying new earfoam for it, after being on your head all day it will start to hurt.\n\nOne last thing to note: DON'T BUY A DAC IF YOU DON'T NEED IT. You might need it for a $500 pair of open-back sennheisers but I guarantee you won't need one for most headphones under $300. Check first, but my ATH-m50x's are powered fine by my motherboards sound card. An amp doesn't improve the quality, it just draws power if the soundcard can't draw enough.",

Not sure how much onboard audio has improved over dedicated cards. \n\nSecondly: \nhttps://imgur.com/a/wbgh19L\nThis are the speakers and sub I currently own(present from a friend) \nWould you recommend the SMSL AD18 to drive these? I don\u2019t really care for the Bluetooth but using the sub could be nice.",

I wasted a lot of money on PC audio which could have got me a much better level and quality of experience in the home theatre department of sound. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think if you need a PC gaming headset, I'd start and stop at the THX Panda's when they finally arrive. Audiophile sound with a wireless option. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor speakers, good passive is always better for sound quality and usually exponentially better value. You can get a pair of near reference-level monitors which can be absolutely awesome.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSadly my love for audio actually shoe-horned me out of desk/PC gaming and towards home theatre gaming because I love audio so much from 2 bookshelfs, I wanted to know what a centre sounded like, and then surrounds, and then atmos speakers, and then a big giantic subwoofer the size of a coffee table.. and before I knew it, I was far away from my desk and in the middle of my new home theatre. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAudio is one of those things where I'd decide quite quickly that you want, buy it at a sensible price and then LEAVE.

        "You\u2019re overthinking it entirely. Songwriting- especially folk music- should come from an honest place in yourself. It just comes from you naturally. Don\u2019t \u201ctry\u201d to do anything. Don\u2019t try to sound like anyone or overanalyze every nuance of how other artists play. YOU just play YOUR way. However it naturally, organically comes out. Be yourself and develop your own style. \nFocus on learning chords then literally just play around with them. You\u2019ll come up with riffs and then melodies will pop into your head as you continue to toy around with chord progressions and words will come to you. There is no exact formula to \u201cbe an indie folk artist.\u201d As corny as it sounds, you\u2019ve gotta just play what\u2019s in your heart! Good luck to you!",
        "1) Practice guitar.  You don;t need to be able to play anything complicated but you need to be able to move through open chords easily.\n\n2) LISTEN.

Now that I\u2019m past the point of being able to catch up, I realized I shouldn\u2019t have been trying to catch up to people who are on their own path. \n\nI\u2019ve just seriously started getting into making music (same style, I love it) in the past two years after playing mediocre guitar for about 10 years. I\u2019m enjoying it more than ever and feel very proud of what I\u2019m creating. It feels very true to myself. \n\nSomething that sticks out to me in the folk genre is its honesty. Both in the content and delivery. Just be you without editing out the parts you don\u2019t think sound nice and I think you\u2019ll find that folk honesty.\n\nTry to write a few reactive songs. Where you aren\u2019t trying to deliver a message or tell a story but you\u2019re just writing a little song as a reaction to something that stuck out to you. I\u2019ve written them reacting to a headline scrolling in a gas station tv, seeing a crochet daisy on a Christmas tree, my cat trying to wake me up, etc. \n\nI\u2019ve found that these songs that happen as a reaction to something tend to be the most honest. If I try to write a song, I\u2019m literally just trying to make something up. If I use my already existing reactions to things to write songs, I can just be who I am and make music out of that. \n\nHope that helps! The shortest answer here is just to make songs. Song after song. Songs that you want to sing or want to hear. \n\nGood luck!",

        "I think to echo what another replier said, I'd steer clear of trying to directly imitate/emulate others and of picking a genre and trying to triangulate to it. I also think theory is overrated in songwriting, and that just finding a chord progression that you instinctively like is a better way to go. One practical thing I'd recommend is trying a few alternate guitar tunings (e.g. Open D) which may help you tap into that more intuitive approach. Just don't retune too often or you'll lose a lot of good guitar strings along the way!\n\nThe thing I noticed with many of the artists you mention is that, while broadly fitting into 'indie folk' or 'folk', they have taken a lot of influences from other genres they're passionate about- Bon Iver from hip hop and soul, Bob Dylan from jazz, Iron & Wine from blues, jazz, all sorts. The interesting thing is then seeing how these influences emerge within the framework of the instruments and techniques available to them and the musical journey that person has already taken. There's a unique alchemy to it which makes that music uniquely redolent of them, not just the overall genre.\nBest of luck with it!\nR",

        "Hey dude. I think it\u2019s important not to conflate a few different skill sets here: music theory, playing guitar, writing a song, and singing. They all definitely have a role in the process but it\u2019s probably smart to distinguish between them so you can focus your efforts. \n\nI think the guitar playing component is the least mysterious. Plenty of notable of songwriters have eked by with minimal skill. You will probably deal mostly with chords, so I\u2019d start there. Beyond major and minor, there are three types of 7 chords (major 7, minor 7, dominant 7) that can add a lot of color and identity to a songs base. I\u2019d focus on learning as many of these shapes as possible. Happy to provide more info on that. \n\nWriting a song is way less clear. It\u2019s super challenging and like others have mentioned the secret sauce is really just doing it over and over ad nauseum. See [THE GAP](https://vimeo.com/85040589) for some classic Ira Glass wisdom. They\u2019ll probably be bad at first but that\u2019s okay. You just have to start, write a song and finish it (finishing is the important bit), and then do it again. \n\nIf I can recommend some literature that might be helpful, I\u2019d highly recommend The War of Art by Steven Pressfield. Spoiler alert, the main thesis of the book is just to fight through resistance and keep creating even when you think it sucks or get discouraged. Great read. Also, if you\u2019re into Uncle Tupelo or Wilco (which by the sound of it you well may be) then I\u2019d also highly recommend Jeff Tweedy\u2019s memoir Let\u2019s Go So We Can Get Back. He has a great philosophy on songwriting and talks about it a lot. He also published a book called How To Write One Song which I haven\u2019t read but imagine is great as well. \n\nSorry for the ramble - good luck! Music is equally frustrating and satisfying but a lifelong journey and definitely worth pursuing.",

    "Question about transposing a guitar part up and down, just a couple of semitones, but still making it sound good.": [
        "I would by all means avoid VariAudio. For at least two reasons: It really only works on monophonic parts (one note at a time, no chords or harmonies); and when it analyzes the track to find harmonic content it always misses the little details in between the notes (string/fret noise, transients or ends of notes, breaths for vocals etc.). While these may seem nice to keep intact it really only creates weird jumps/glitches in your sound.\n\nInstead, opt for the built in Pitch Shift processing. I almost always use the algorithm Poly Complex Formant if I want a transparent pitch shift. You could also try just Poly Complex, which won't preserve your formant but may sound good. IMHO, the other algos are really only useful for saving some loading time (they're faster) or creating lo-fi sounds, but your mileage may certainly vary. Try the Musical algos, and if it's a monophonic sound you could go for the Solo algos, but I find treating each sound as Poly and Complex will work better as all real sounds have polyphonic overtones and are pretty complex.",
        "I actually would use the VariAudio (i think its called) if its a Wav track. Treat it like a vocal track, and in that midi grid after analysis, you see the actual transitions from one note to another. Transposing here and manipulating the notes/chords works well for this. Double-click the audio bit to open editor pane, and here you should have an option to analyze it and manipulate it. JUST REMEMBER TO DUPLICATE THE TRACK SO YOU ALWAYS HAVE THE ORIGINAL TRACK FOR BACKUP \ud83d\ude0a Hope this helps \ud83d\udc4d",
        "Probably you can start recording at higher sample rates so when you change the pitch the transitions  are smoother.",

        "Wow i didn't think I would be able to read the whole thing but it was actually very interesting and I agree with a lot of things. Regarding what you said about Han, I feel that when they released the 3racha mixtapes he was still experimenting and trying to find his style(he was 16 I believe?) and the others did as well. They reacted to their old songs and they admitted that they have changed a lot since then. I think that Han has found his style (of course there is still a lot of room for improvement) and what you said was noticeable in their 3racha releases and their early stray kids songs. Here are some recent songs in case you are interested: [Carpe diem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNfkK15RC9w)  [We go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUEwXTY7_Do) [Passion](https://twitter.com/moondangdang/status/1293538721078243329).\n\nRegarding Han's freestyle, what i find spectacular is his ability to change the flow and keep it interesting and natural. [Here](https://twitter.com/luvmrk127/status/1277776072990322690) he has the context in front of him but i still find it impressive.\n\nThat's it lol but i agree with almost everything else. Is there a chance that you will do bts?( I just wanna see paragraphs full of praises lmao).",
        "I read your last post and I was definitely waiting for this analysis!! Thank you in advance for your effort!!!\n\n\n> the biggest criticism I have with Han is that his vocal quality is so similar to other idol rappers as to be almost indistinguishable.\n\nI actually agree. As a stan, I *can* tell Hyunjin and Han apart by ear but even then, their rapping tones are extremely similar so for many casuals they sound nearly indistinguishable.\n\n\n>[Chan's] strengths have clearly always been more on the production end and that seems to be where he's keeping them for now.\n\nAgree! But also pretty evident? I know a lot of people assume 3RACHA = SKZ Rap Line when in fact **3RACHA has always been SKZ's producing unit** which is also why I'm surprised you decided to exclude Hyunjin and Felix from your analysis \ud83d\ude32.\n\n \nI'm curious if these rankings will change with the upcoming repackage (literally 7 days away). There's 8 new tracks (including a full version GoLive) which might've given you more recent/relevant research material.\n\n(Also, slightly satisfying that it goes C > B > A haha)",
        "I can't comment much on technical aspects, but I can provide a bit of information on Han's tone.\n\nI will never be able to find where it was said, but I don't think Han will be experimenting much more with his tone for a little while.\n\nHan has said he used to hate the higher tone to his voice so he would purposefully pitch it lower and it ended up screwing up his voice a bit (temporarily I believe). From what I understand he doesn't mind his tone now, but I think it will be a minute before he tries to mess with it again (at least I hope he does it with professional guidance).\n\nAlso, for his imitations, he does a lot of imitations just in general so I almost wonder if any imitations were partially accidental or just him experimenting with some different things. \n\nAs for Chan, I think he may have lost a bit of confidence in rapping after their reality show. JYP criticized him a bit and I think he lost some confidence, especially when you consider he didn't rap at all in We Go or Zone. Chan's strength is definitely producing. \n\nI will also say that while much of the 3RACHA tracks have some questionable lyrics, it was good practice and good for criticism to improve. \n\nStreetlight may have not had the strongest beat, but Changbin did produce it himself. I think of the 3 he is the one working on his producing the most. That track is also just straight up emotional and I refuse to criticize it beyond that. I think at the moment Changbin's strength is lyrics and he's continuing to improve on production.",

        "I am not technical abt rapping but just provide some perspectives here, based on what 3Racha said themselves.\n\nSo for Chan, he is the main producer. Beatmaker, arranger, topline writer.\n\nChangbin and Han handle the raps (the flow and the lyrics; so for example Hyunjin's flow in District9 is written by Changbin) and they are also into producing (they have songs produce by themselves) but a bit lighter role than Chan.\n\nAn example of them working is with Easy (this comes from the usa co-producer's interview) and from 1 vlive when they produced live: So they got the demo from the producer, Changbin+Han heard it then they would fixate on their phones to write the rap. Meanwhile, Chan is working with the co-producer team to write the verse, the hook. But if Changbin + Han heard st they like, they would definitely give a signal. Then after a while, Changbin would get into the recording booth to deliver what he wrote so far and for easy, the coproducer said the energy was crazy so the whole team (producer team+Chan) has to deliver something to match that level of energy.\n\nHan said it himself when he started rapping, he didn't understand tone, so he started by trying out a lot. But now both Changbin and Han said it actually becomes his strength that he is able to switch tones and create diversity in his rap. (One famous among fans is probably Zone by 3Racha) Changbin and Chan also said that Han is a very fast thinker and he is able to rap by just giving him texts (like giving news or a series of fans' comments). They said there is time they used news as lyrics instead (during producing) and Han just matched it to the beat.\n\nSKZ members have all said that Changbin is actually very good with lyrics, and they said it so many times. A lot of creative ideas of SKZ come from him (e.g.,hellevator, broken compass). The solo he did that you mentioned with the cheesy beat is a soft style he always wanted to try, not his normal style. But the lyrics and the metaphor in that one are very beautiful. They said that all the JYP staffs who heard the song cried and Han also said it himself that he has mad respect for that lyrics.",

        "This is really interesting. For me, Chan really excels in the cloud rap and whatever it was that he was doing in Go Live. Otherwise, he has been pretty hit or miss. Sometimes the accent actually distracts me when he\u2019s rapping in English. He\u2019s definitely a better producer and vocalist than a rapper. I\u2019m saying this as an SKZ fan and Chan bias. \n\nHan is very talented, but I agree that there\u2019s room for improvement. Even his vocals get shouty sometimes, which is a pet peeve as I was taught from a very young age not to shout when singing. I think his energy is what\u2019s carrying him even during his weaker raps/performances. He\u2019s fun to watch, and it makes up for a lot. I don\u2019t want to say anything about him imitating Suga or Zico\u2019s flow, as I don\u2019t have a good ear for it. I would say just from watching their Hi-Stay Japan videos and God\u2019s Menu/Easy stages, that he has really improved a lot. \n\nThere\u2019s no contest when it comes to Changbin. Even Han admits that Changbin is the better rapper. The fact that he has a distinct rapping sound at his age is impressive to me, especially when it\u2019s so far from his normal singing voice and is clearly a deliberate choice. Streetlight, though...I really didn\u2019t like some of the choices they made in that song, but I was willing to forgive it because it was still a good one, and it really just comes down to preference.

        "A nice write up. I\u2019ve had a MODX6 myself for about a year and a half now and I am also loving it. When shows start up again it\u2019s going to be my go to synth for live performances. It can do anything. Also, the subtractive synthesis capabilities aren\u2019t immediately obvious, but they\u2019re there, albeit in a bit of a roundabout fashion. You can treat the elements of an AWM2 patch like individual oscillators and take it from there.",
        "I saw this video (https://youtu.be/8VbMzParso8 ) that explains how the pianos don\u2019t sound their best until you edit the velocity curves. Check that out to see if it makes it even better for you.\n\nI loved the idea of the MODX when it was announced. I played one in person and while the UI wasn\u2019t bad, I didn\u2019t love it. though that\u2019s probably due to needing to spend more time with it. The keybed i thought was just ok. Although I really love the price point, so I can\u2019t complain. Overall i think i want to get one at some point. Seems like a great gigging instrument with the montage sound set and a lighter weight.",
        "I almost bought the small one a while ago but I ended up with a Prologue. Completely different obviously. If I played out and about more I would have gotten the modx. Seems like a great synth engine and it has all those other sounds in it, which are good to play with all my guitarist friends.",
        "Can anyone who has had both FS1R and Montage/MODx comment on the similarity in sound quality. Because if this can be a FS1R with decent programmability, that will sell me. The sound quality on FS1R is superb, but I sold mine after getting just very frustrated with having to press arrow keys 17 times just to modify a different FM operator... \n\nI know it doesn't have the formant engine, but a lot of the great FS1R presets just used straight 8-op FM.   And I did give up and use mostly presets.  I know how to program FM, but the interface was really that terrible.\n\nI'm still hugely skeptical of Montage/MODX because of all the terrible demos about.  That people are using the Montage as 'arranger' and playing just the most hideous generic elevator music crap... even Matt Johnson's demo is pretty bad.",
        "I wish they'd put the MODX sound engine into a rack mount chassis. \n\nI'm guessing the samples are probably the same as the samples in the Clavinova and those sound great. On the Clavinova there are dedicated buttons for the C7 and the Bosendorfer so you can switch between them."

        "[HHH Community Playlist #1: '90s G-Funk // Playlist & Discussion Thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/ikz2b4/hhh_community_playlist_1_90s_gfunk_playlist/)",
        "I firmly consider this one of the greatest albums of the 90s. I often refer to it as \"gothic\" hip-hop; various horror themes barked over haunting melodies, with some of the most frightening and cold bars of the decade delivered. Despite all this, I never felt that the album came across as edgy; everything X said was clearly authentic and came from a place of personal darkness and angst.\n\nX really wasn't afraid to show his true self, whether that be the whimpering pup looking for a home or the lunatic Pitbull frothing at the mouth, and I think that this is what gave him a crossover appeal. I didn't have a difficult life, and I certainly was never a gangster, but when X rapped about the demons pulling him apart from the inside, I really connected with it (I was coincidentally later diagnosed with bipolar, which I believe X was also diagnosed with). I was also angry, and frightened, and secretly hoping that one day I could be a better sort of person, and so even though I've never been religious I still felt an empathy for X on tracks like Prayer and The Convo.\n\nI think that this album has aged fantastically well, for the reasons previously mentioned; X never comes across as being needlessly edgy or provocative, and so the album remains a window into the inner conflicts of one of hip-hop's most tortured artists. The production used is so imposing and atmospheric that it doesn't seem to have suffered either; again, it all matches the spirit of the album so well that it just doesn't seem to age in the same way that many albums from the 90s have.\n\nX ruled hip-hop for a long time, and I think that it was really a result of leaning into an image that he projected as time went on. Although I enjoy his following albums, I feel that they are slightly less honest on the whole, especially the post-00s efforts. X successfully marketed himself and backed that up with genuine talent, although I sometimes wonder how much that contributed to his struggles with substance abuse.\n\nI hold out hope that X can still give us something incredible, if he stays on the correct path. I would personally love to hear a sequel to this album; a lot of this album covers X's fears that his 'dark side' would win, and as we've seen... It kind of did. I would love to hear an older and sober X return to this subject, exploring where things might have gone wrong and what he learned from it. With the current trend of benzo glorification in hip-hop, I think that X could be a very powerful voice of concern and education if he's in the right mindset.\n\nI think that X's reputation in hip-hop has been tarnished by his various struggles with the law and substance abuse. Unfortunately, many younger people know him as the guy who did that Rick and Morty song, and the guy that's always in prison. Regardless, anyone who was into hip-hop at the turn of the millennium can attest to what a force of nature the man was, and I think he'll always have a degree of reverence from the older heads out there.",
        "I just listened to this album during a long car ride like 3 days ago. It hasn\u2019t aged one bit. If it came out today, it would still be just as legit. One of the best intros ever, and it just has the pain and hype levels of X from front to back.",
        "One of the hardest albums i\u2019ve ever had a pleasure listening to. Whenever i\u2019m frustrated or pissed at anything this is my go to material. Sonically it\u2019s awesome, production is top notch, they captured a gritty dark vibe of the east coast, his deep voice and growls sound perfect across those beats, his flow and delivery is ... i think unmatched to this day (i don\u2019t really hear the type of flow X used on this album nowadays). And then the songs... god damn each one is awesome in it\u2019s own way. I still remember the shock i had from hearing the X is coming for you lyrics for the first time. Gruesome. People tend to say Raekwon managed to paint a great picture using only words on Only built for cuban linx. I didn\u2019t get that from him, i got it from X. Personally (and before i get attacked by hhh-ers i will accentuate the word PERSONALLY) this is my favourite album of all time. I understand why some don\u2019t like it, why others don\u2019t consider it a classic but for me it hits home. Originality, production, lyrics, flow, delivery the whole body of work is incredible and unmatched. And the best part? It\u2019s his debut... this is how he came out, fucking swingin\u2019 home runs left and right. Incredible.",
        "[The vinyl anniversary re-release of this album is really cool](https://imgur.com/a/boxc8ei)\n\nThey did a really cool job with the gold vinyl and it's one of the nicer \"golds\" Ive seen done for a record. My only gripe is that the sleeve isn't a bi-fold, but I'm not complaining. Flesh of my Flesh also has a really cool blood spatter effect on the discs, but I'll save that for another time. \n\nAbsolutely it's a classic, a *hardcore* classic as it's tone and style won't be for everyone. \n\n**I think DMX did so well with his first five albums because it was at the right time in the right place,** Eminem's popularity was surging like crazy back then and people were hungry for hardcore offensive shit. It also helped that Nu-Metal at the time created cross-genre appeal and many metalheads and rock fans like me found themselves listening to cross over features on Limp Bizkit albums for example, or even other artists. DMX was huge and successful because he was everywhere at the time and stylistically he was edgy along with Eminem AND catchy. from about 1998 until probably 2004 rap had a MASSIVE cross-over appeal to fans of other genres and that's why albums from Eminem, DMX, Dr Dre, Method Man and etc from back then are so HUGE and a big part of everyone's collective memory from that era. \n\nDMX fell off because he's dealt with a crippling drug addiction most his life, which lead to bad partnerships, bad songs and just a total lack of motivation later in his career. **How do you stay hungry when your first five albums all go #1 and you've achieved things that probably no other artist in rap's history have done? He was a victim of his own success.**\n\n**I think DMX is an American national treasure and if he manages to stay clean and reformed and partners with some people who wanna see him back on top and aren't out for themselves, he'll do great things again.**\n\n**Do I think DMX has the talent and capability to create a new album that's as good as his first 2 or 3 albums? Yes I absolutely do.** In fact, I'll even say I think he still has some of his best material he's ever done within him, it's just a matter of if he can stay focused and healthy to do it. **One of the biggest tragedies in life is watching talent go to waste. I hope he's come to the that realization.**\n\nNas just put out an incredible album with Hit-Boy. **Do I think there are producers out there who could create an *incredible* modern styled album with DMX? Yes, I do.**\n\n**DMX's comeback and success all depend on him**. Some of the greatest people and artists in history though are often savants and victims of themselves. DMX is an example of this, but I don't think it's too late for him to turn it around and release something mind-blowing. He's *that* good and talented, *even still.* I should also point out that yes, he does appear to be on the straight and narrow, *for now,* I just hope he keeps at it. \n\nDMX, the world needs you and **we're all still big fans that wanna see you be successful and release some god-tier shit.**",
        "Favorite album of all time, I've done countless write ups on other accounts about this album, and other subsequent DMX albums.  Flesh Of My Flesh, Blood Of My Blood is amazing as well, but this album is a debut in every sense of the word. It introduces DMX, and paints a very vivid picture of who this man is. His strengths, his weaknesses, his insecurities, and this grapple he has with himself and his faith in God.",

        "DMX really has one of the most under-appreciated cadences/deliveries of all time. Lyrics complex and emotional enough to provoke thought and connection, but simple enough to reach a global audience. His delivery is so unique and has yet to be matched since. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a rapper able to be more honest in his lyrics on a consistent basis without fear.",
        "Imo the best hip-hip record of 1998 and very deserving of being called a classic. I can only think of a handful albums imo that match up to the same level of darkness. The title and dark red cover give you a perfect idea of what you\u2019re about to get into, the atmosphere is aggressive, ominous, and at some points transparent and vulnerable (I.E. Damien, The Convo, Look Thru My Eyes)\n\nNot only that, but this is his best produced album. I\u2019m not the biggest fan of Swizz Beats\u2019 sound all over Flesh of My Flesh and whatnot. I can\u2019t help but wonder where X\u2019s career would\u2019ve went had he not released his three best albums within a two year span (his other various problems notwithstanding).",
        "Might be the fact that This was the biggest album during my high school years, or that Ruff Ryders/Cash Money was the first concert I ever went to, first time I ever smoked a blunt, had a chick twerk on me at, but this album and DMX in general will always be one of my favorites. He was completely different than the rest of hip hop at the time. There was a legitimate argument whether he or Jigga were the king of New York in 98.",
        "I remember when this album came out.  As OP said, this album came out during \"the shiny suit era.\" Rap/hip hop at the time felt very pop influenced. \n\nThis album hit like a ton of bricks.  It felt/was aggressive, gritty and was an otherwise departure from the current sound (at least to the hip hop I was exposed to at the time).  I get nostalgic listening to the intro. It is so good.  \n\nI ended up giving my CD to the girl I had a crush on who was moving out of the country.\n\n\nEdit: answering OP's questions.  It's a shame what happened to DMX later in his career.  I think this album kicked off a huge run for him and the Ruff Ryders.  I definitely think he fell off later in his career but not sure how much of that is attributed to his drug/legal problems.  I think if he kept up with consistent album releases, he could have been one of the goats.",
        "A classic and one of my top 10 favorite rap albums ever. While I enjoyed the shiny suit rap, X\u2019s gritty street style was needed to bring some balance back to the game. Dude\u2019s flow, delivery, and cadence was so unique and memorable, his verses just stuck with you. He was highly underrated as a lyricist back then too, he wasn\u2019t on a Nas or Jay level but he was much better than he got credit for. Swizz, Irv, and Dame Grease blessed him on here and unfortunately he never got that quality of production for a whole project again. My favorite rappers at the time right before this album were Nas, Biggie, and Mase but mannn, X put himself right up there after this. I thought his reign as one of the top MCs was going to last much longer, sucks his demons were so strong.",

        "Listened to this album to death since it came out.\n\nI actually met X once in Toronto when he was in town filming Romeo Must Die(i think this was like 2000). I was working with this photographer as an assistant doing a shoot at this nice hotel that X was staying at downtown. \n\nWe were coming out of the hotel garage when my boss had to stop to look for directions. All of a sudden this Cadillac SUV with tinted windows started honking at us from behind and this guy sticks his head out (DMX) yelling for us to \"MOVE THE FUCKING CAR\". We didn't know yet that this was DMX. Just thought it was some crazy road rage guy behind us. My boss yelled back at him to relax and the guy jumped out the car LITERALLY BARKING AT US WITH EXPLETIVES. I was like yo this guy is gonna road rage on us hard let's go quick. So we drove off and bounced fast lol \n\nLater on we headed back to the hotel for the second part of our shoot and I spotted the guy that was yelling at us earlier with an entourage. I was like oh shit he looks familiar could it be.... Then before i could even think about it for a quick second i saw \"DMX\" on the back of his jacket! I WAS LIKE WTF ! I tell my boss that the guy yelling at us earlier is a famous rapper but he doesn't listen to hiphop so he was just like oh that's kinda cool. I'm star-struck but at the same time DMX was about to pull up on us earlier so i was kinda worried if he was gonna recognize us from earlier lol \n\nAnyways my boss was like he needed to go to the bathroom so we headed to the washroom down the hall. He passes me his camera which was like one of those huge medium format ones with a huge flash on it. Literally looked like a paparazzi kinda camera and asked me to hold on to it while he goes inside the washroom. I'm like waiting and texting ppl that i just ran into DMX freaking out(still star-struck) when all of sudden DMX WALKS RIGHT BY ME AND GOES INTO THE WASHROOM. I'm like oh shit what do i do?! Is my boss gonna get a beat down when DMX realizes the encounter earlier??! So i wasn't sure what what to do. So i burst into the washroom lol tripping all over myself. Both my boss and DMX were at the urinal. DMX looks at me and this big ass camera and was like \"DAWG NO PHOTOS! LET A MAN PISS IN PEACE! F*CK\"  then i was like no no no we are here doing a shoot upstairs,  we not paparazzi. I was expecting a beat down then for sure. However DMX washed his hands and was like the friendliest guy I ever met. We dapped and talked for about 10 mins and we got photos with him too. Told us he is in town shooting a movie and he had the night off was about to go play pool/billiards. He also had a small black case with his personal cue stick that looked mad expensive. Anyways we told him that was us earlier and we squashed that beef right there. Oh and i told him how much of a classic It's Dark and Hell is Hot is to me. Mad respect to DMX.",
        "1. It definitely deserves to be called a classic. Great album front to back imo, even more so considering it's his debut.\n2. It aged very well imo. Production still fire, as are Xs bars.\n3. idk, but probably because of his work ethic at the time. Two albums in 98 alone, and 5 in the span of 6 years, all of them quality. Definitely not a fluke imo. Dude is a great rapper.\n4. Idk, hard to say whether his fall off was inevitable. I believe if it weren't for the drug addiction he'd def be more of a staple than he is now. Whether with the same quality or less so, he'd be like the other 90s rappers (Nas, Snoop, etc), and OG that still releases music. Sadly, with his addiction and incarcerations he fell a bit off the map and it feels like sometimes ppl forget about him and how huge he was end of the 90s/early 00s\n5. Not a what-if imo, as he released enough dope albums in his prime. But I feel him falling off the map because of his problems made people forget about him a bit, at least it feels like it. So his legacy may be a bit underrated today. Dude is definitely one of the greats imo. Insane talent plus a perfect voice and delivery for hardcore street raps.",

        "For string instruments, that would help with efficient with certain passages and convenience for different chord voicings. \n\nSaxophones, and some other wind instruments, do a thing called \"timbral trills\" (usually in jazz) where we repeat the same note with either an alternate fingering or different embouchure to alter the timbre of the note. For guitar I suppose playing the same note on different strings could emulate this effect, although I would think that the difference in timbre wouldn't be as drastic.",

        "There\u2019s an open-G tuning that a band called Eagles of Death Metal use for their guitars that uses a unison on the lowest strings. The tuning is: G-G-D-g-B-d. The 2 low G notes ringing out give you a droning, almost chorus like effect that is important to the timbre of the music\n\nThe Velvet Underground and Sonic Youth are known for using strange tunings that they sometimes call ostrich tunings where most of if not all the strings are tuned to the same note. Venus in Furs was recorded using a guitar in D-D-D-D-d-d. The guitars used on SY\u2019s Kool Thing were tuned F#-F#-F#-F#-E-B\n\nThis is important for the timbre to have all these strings ringing out that are reinforcing each other",
        "There is a lot of potential. The same note appears in at least three places on the guitar. The string, fret position, distance from pickups and bridge all contribute to variations in tone at those positions. Moving the note to these different locations will greatly affect the harmonic content of the played sound. So one note against the same one will still sound \"different\" on a stringed instrument.  Additionaly the actual pitch is likely to change between two fretted notes of the same pitch. Guitars will not perfectly intonate, basically  ever. Therefore you will hear pitch contrast between two notes also for the fundamental.",
        "Sometimes it\u2019s just easier in given situations to hit a note on a different string, like if you\u2019re doing a pattern that you would have to break if you wanted to go to the next string maybe. I don\u2019t know, not a guitar player other than basic chords. There\u2019s just options and in given situations some are easier and some are more difficult",
        "You can play the same note 5 or 6 places on the guitar depending on how many frets you have.",
        "This is common in guitar music.  You'll get some repeated pattern featuring both stopped and open strings, and the pattern just moves up and down the neck, so sometimes you have a stopped string below an open string, sometimes the same string is higher than the open string, and sometimes it's the same note, and that relationship keeps changing as the open strings don't change pitch while the stopped ones do.",
        "Besides the uses on guitar that have been mentioned, concert harps do this. For example, if you set the B strings to B# (C) and the F strings to Fb (E), you end up with a pentatonic scale: C, D, E, G, A.",
        "For most of the notes on a piano you're always playing \"the same note on two \\[or three\\] different strings\" whether you like it or not!

        "Sure. There are some chord voicings that may use it (and it's especially useful if you leave for example the two highest strings open on a guitar and move a chord shape up and down - those open strings make the chords sound connected). Also, unison bends are a common technique used in rock music.",
        "String instruments with double courses (mandolin, 12-string guitar) use a harmonic unison between some or all of the pairs of strings.\n\nIt's used quite regularly on guitar where a player will hit a note a half or whole step below the pitch of the next higher open string, then hammer or slide the finger up to the unison and play both strings. It has a particular sound to it.\n\nIan Anderson uses the technique at the beginning of My God\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WSulenOUb0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WSulenOUb0)\n\nTony Rice uses the technique for the intro to Stony Point.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsrtPbe0POc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsrtPbe0POc)",
        "The timbre of the open high E string is much different from the timbre of the same note played at the 14th fret on the D string.\n\nSince a guitar is never *really* in tune with itself, playing the same note on two separate strings will create a sort of \"chorused\" sound due to slight differences in tuning.",
        "It can be pretty useful on distorted guitar to give it a different timbre and accent a certain note within a chord. For instance, C#m with an open high E string in addition to the fretted E on the B string sounds a little bit different than without the open E.\n\nIt's especially useful as a droning tone while playing a melody on another string as you can have an illusion of going between 1 note and 2 notes but the sound stays full and timbre stays mostly the same. For a good example of this you can listen to the guitar at the beginning of My Hero by the Foo Fighters.\n\nIt also can just make things sound more aggressive to play fretted and open strings with the same pitch. You get a stronger transient from picking multiple strings and combine the resonance of both strings. Plus it's easier to strum more aggressively if you aren't worried as much about only strumming one string (this also requires good muting technique to make sure you don't have all the other strings sounding). A good example of this is the prechorus of On My Own by Saosin - https://youtu.be/AqfgiPfxSdA?t=37.\n\nAll of these factors are much more about timbre than actual harmony though. So for genres where timbre is typically less significant (classical, folk, etc.) I would say it isn't really that significant. However in terms of harmony it does enable a lot of droning notes for pedal point progressions or interesting spread voicings of chords."

        "When \u23f0 a song \ud83c\udfb6\ud83c\udfb5\ud83c\udfa4 is converted \u21aa into MIDI \ud83c\udd92, you \ud83d\udc49 can still \ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\ude4c hear \ud83d\udc42 vocals \ud83d\udde3 because of Timbre.   \n  \nIf you're playing \ud83c\udfae guitar \ud83e\udd20\ud83c\udfb8, when \u23f0 you \ud83d\udc48 pluck \ud83e\udd0f one \u261d\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc of the strings \ud83c\udfa3 it makes \ud83d\udd95 a bunch \ud83c\udf7c of frequencies \ud83d\udce1.   \n  \nThe loudest is called \ud83d\udcf2 the fundamental \ud83d\udc91, which is the note \ud83d\udcdd\ud83d\udd75\ud83d\udd2d we hear \ud83d\udc42.   \n  \nThe others \ud83d\udc6a are called \ud83d\udcde overtones, and while we don't \ud83d\udeab 'hear' \ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\ude49 them, the overtones are what make \ud83d\udd95 a violin \ud83d\ude02 sound \ud83d\udc42 different \ud83d\ude21 from a piano \ud83c\udfb9, for example \ud83d\udcaa.   \n  \nThe overtones are what we call \ud83d\udcde\u260e an instrument's \ud83c\udfb8 Timbre.   \n  \nSince \ud83d\udc68 a MIDI \ud83c\udd92 is like \ud83d\ude04\ud83e\udd8a sheet \ud83d\udc49 music \ud83c\udfbc\ud83c\udfb5\ud83c\udfb8 being read \ud83d\udcd6 by a computer \ud83d\udcbb, when \ud83c\udf51 you \ud83d\udc48 convert \ud83d\udebf\ud83e\uddf9\ud83c\udf2a an MP3 to MIDI \ud83c\udd92, it doesn't just write \ud83d\udcdd the fundamental \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2696\ufe0f\u2728 pitch \ud83d\ude24.   \n  \nPt \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\udc45 counts \ud83d\udd22 any slight \ud83d\udc4c changes \ud83d\udebc in pitch \ud83c\udfa4 and volume \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc66 as new \ud83d\udc4c notes \ud83d\udcdd, and also \ud83d\udc68 writes \u270d down \u2b07 the overtones.   \n  \nThe human \ud83d\udc64 voice \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\udce2 also \ud83d\udc68 has overtones, so despite \ud83d\udeab the sound \ud83c\udf0b\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udd0a being a piano \ud83c\udfb9, (the default \ud83d\ude4a instrument \ud83c\udfbb\ud83c\udfba for most MIDI \ud83c\udd92 DLSes,) the MIDI \ud83c\udd92 is still \ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\ude4c playing \ud83c\udfbd the overtones, so you \ud83d\udc49 can still \ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\ude4c hear \ud83d\udc42 the voices \ud83d\udd0a.   \n  \nAlso \ud83d\udc68, MP3 is an audio file \ud83d\udcc2, so the reason \ud83c\udf1f every \ud83d\udcaf sound \ud83d\udd0a is a piano \ud83c\udfb9 is because it was as if every \u261d\ud83c\udffc sound \ud83d\udc42, (drums \ud83e\udd41 and all \ud83d\udcaf,) were being played \ud83c\udfb2 in the same channel \ud83d\udcfa\ud83d\udce1.   \n  \nAnd since \ud83d\udc68 drums \ud83e\udd41 technically \ud83e\udd4b\ud83e\udd39 have pitch \ud83c\udfa4, as well \ud83d\ude26\ud83d\udc40\ud83e\udd37 as overtones, that's \ud83d\ude26 why \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd37 you \ud83d\udc48 hear \ud83d\udc42 that low \ud83d\udd09 'horror' \ud83d\ude31 sound \ud83d\udd0a in a converted \u21aa drum \ud83e\udd41 MIDI \ud83c\udd92.   \n  \n(Note \ud83d\udcd3\ud83d\udcda\ud83d\udcd2: MIDI \ud83c\udd92 technically \ud83d\udd27\u274c isn't an audio file \ud83d\ude0d, as nothing \u274c\u274e has been recorded \ud83d\udcf7\ud83d\udcf8\ud83c\udfa5. It's more like \ud83d\udc4d sheet \ud83d\udecf music \ud83d\udd0a\ud83c\udfb5\ud83c\udfb6 in that it's a set \ud83d\udcd0 of instructions \u26a0 being read \ud83d\udcd6 to a computer \ud83d\udcbb, i.e \ud83c\udf6d\ud83c\udd71; 'Play \ud83c\udfbd this sound \ud83d\udc42 at this pitch \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\ude46\ud83c\udffb at this time.' \u23f0)",

        "When music is converted to MIDI, you can listen to songs for a ton.\n\nIf you want to remove one of the strings and play the guitar, create a lot of frequencies.\n\nThe biggest voice is that we actually hear the recording.\n\nOthers call it dubbing and we don't hear it, but dubbing makes a different violin sound than a piano.\n\nDubbing is a tool we call Tim Bray.\n\nMIDI is like a music table read from a computer, so the main field is not written when you convert MP3 to MIDI.\n\nPt calculates small changes in process and volume, such as new notes and other recordings.\n\nHuman voices also have a rear sound, so even listening like a piano (the main instrument in most MIDI DLSes), midi still plays bass so you can hear the sound.\n\nIn addition, MP3 is an audio file, so it seems that all sounds are played on the same channel, so all sounds are piano.\n\nDrums technically have the same tone, so you hear a low \"horror\" in the MIDI drum converter.\n\n(Note: Technically MIDI is not an audio file because it has no record, it's like music, read on your computer as \"Play this sound in the field at the moment\".)"

    "Fostex TH-X00 Mahogany - My First Review": [
        "I picked up these for $260 USD from a kid off Craigslist who said he liked his Bose better...Lucky me!",
        "Nice write-up.  I have the Ebony version though I hardly ever use them anymore.  I do agree that the stock pads are awful, they just feel so incredibly cheap.  The Dekoni sheepskin pads (non-perforated) don\u2019t change the sound that I can tell but they are much more comfortable if you ever feel like upgrading.",
        "Great writeup my dude! \n\nJapanese audio never ceases to impress, right?",
        "The pair I bought from a fellow forum user had ZMF Ori lambskin pads on them. Extremely comfortable, should give them a look.",
        "Nice write up mate, I love the inclusion of the songs and how they sound with the X00. They're pretty great headphones aren't they? I had the same thing happen with my 770's, I just don't use them for music listening at all anymore but I still love them as gaming+work headphones.",
        "Accessory House makes some great sheepskin pads for these.\n\nAgreed otherwise. It's a great headphone, even if it can be a tad sharp, the bass kicks like nothing else. \n\nE-mu Teaks are also very good, but they boost the mids considerably at the expense of some of the bass speed/decay and have less sharp treble.",
        "IT WAS YOU! DAMN YOU! :P",
        "Great review. Where do you pick up your FLAC files for things like Trance and Garage?",
        "Great write-up and most of your findings are parallel to mine except for a couple of things like timbre and head stage.\n\nIf it weren't for the slightly below average comfort of the pads, questionable durability of the hinges and non-removable cables - I would have EQ'd this and have likely been very happy with them in my rotation.",
        "I've got a pair of ebonies and mahoganies right now.. and I'm honestly probably gonna keep the latter. I don't understand how people call the ebonies bass cannons? Maybe I'm missing something, but I think the mahogany does low end way better, but the ebony has a lil something something in the upper ranges... It's gonna be a hard choice"
