Gretsch Super HiLo'tron Analysis
I bought a Gretsch GT5622T a few months back when there was a crazy sale on Adorama, like this one. The quality is really high, for an $800 guitar, or the $500 I paid for it. It looks and feels even more premium than a comparably priced Epiphone. It's essentially an 335 type guitar, but the center block only extends around the bridge, the area in and around the pickups is completely hollow, so it retains a lot of hollow body character and is very light weight.
The GT5622T is an imported guitar, and the HiLo Supers are the typical "BHK" type pickups found in other FMIC imports. Supposedly BHK stands for "BooHeung Precision Machinery in Korea" , who make musical instrument and automotive parts. They tend to be high quality pickups, with real AlNiCo magnets and attention to details where it counts.
I didn't really love the look of the Super HiLo trons though, and I had some Fireli'trons sitting around, so I put them in and took the Supers out, which gives me a chance to see what they're all about. I analyzed standard HiLo'Trons here http://www.gretsch-talk.com/threads/gretsch-hilotron-analysis-and-review.159653/ , those are true single coil pickups with an massive AlNiCo magnet beside the coil.
These Super HiLo'trons are actually humbuckers, a lot like a PAF style humbucker, with one row of screws and one with slugs, and a slim sized AlNiCo 5 bar. That's the end of the similarity though, the inductance of the Super HiLo'tron is very low, less than half of a PAF, and very much like a typical Filter'tron. The coil bobbins are much smaller than PAF bobbins and can only hold a fraction of the wire by mass.
The main difference between the Super and a Filter'tron, aside from the appearance, is just that the Super has a much weaker magnetic profile, in terms of the completeness of the magnetic circuit and the strength of the magnetic field. If you take a standard Filter'tron and lower it a few millimetres and raise one row of the screws, it should sound identical to a Super HiLo'tron.
Interestingly, where as a PAF has screws that stop at the base plate, the Super HiLo's slugs are more like rivets, with a flat head at the top, and a long shaft that protrudes out the bottom, also similar to the shape of a screw. The extra steel that sticks out of the bottom causes the overall magnetic field to be weaker, the output would increase slightly if they were snipped off with wire cutters.
The bridge and neck pickups are nearly identical spec-wise, and physically. The bridge pickup is taller, as is tradition, but only because the cover is taller and the legs are longer. Even though the base plate leg length is neck and bridge specific, they nevertheless put lead wire holes at either end of the base plate, so that it could be used easily in either spot.
As far as the sound goes, I thought they sounded more single coil than humbucker, and that might be because the row of screws is so much closer to the strings than are the slugs. The Gretsch style filister screws sit a lot higher than PAF filister screws.

Interesting, thanks!
Cool! Those look nice on that guitar.
I snagged one of those green ones on that Adorama sale, too. Killer deal on a great guitar. I like the stock pickups. I put .011 flat wounds on it and have played the crap out of it.
I too grabbed one if these from Adorama for 450, great deal, as I was after the SHLTs pickups. I’m not disappointed, and in fact it has the least amount of mods that I typically run on Electromatics. I pulled my neck pickup apart when I was testing out GFS’s new Filtertron-sized pickups. It was basically a Blacktop Filtertron with a coil using slugs...El Oh El.
Glad you did this write up because I’m that much more compelled to try Novak’s humbucking HiLo’trons. Maybe he used a bigger magnet, and a dummy coil? IDK, steep price to find out. Other than that, I kinda just want to put some regular HiLos or TV-HTs in this thing...
Vintage Hilo'trons are literally half a Filter'tron. Wound with thinner wire and relocated magnet.
Good article here. Apparently, TV Jones' favourite pickup.

I like that the Gretsch branded HiLo'Trons have the correct looking filister screws, where as the TV Joens have these funny looking little screws, but according to my info, the TV Jones HiLo has a hotter bridge, which probably sounds better.
Single coils, I dig them with some drive, but they're kind of thin when they're 100% clean, and I like to pair a hollow body with a clean amp, so I was eager to get a humbucker in the Gretsch. It turns out it already had one, but the height difference between the screws and the slugs in the Super HiLo make it perform like a single coil.

TVJ uses a screw that’s more correct in shape, and actually the Gretsch reproductions didn’t follow their own conventions. I also like the hotter TV-HT bridge, though. HiLo’s are some of my favorite single coils. You can see the funky details of the screw on my mid 60s Corvette. For me, it’s always single coils, HBs are ok if they sound like them...

And Filter'trons some of the best hummers.
Really we're lucky we can still get versions of these plus PAFs, Dano lipsticks, Ric Toasters, WRHBs.
That's interesting the bridge has a slightly higher inductance and resistance. Normally, you'd want that on the neck pickup, for more clarity, and a bit more girth in the bridge position.

Nice analysis, Antigua! I'm a big fan of Hilo'trons, TV-HTs, Super Hilo's, Filter'trons, TVJ Classics, and T-Armonds. I guess that means many of my favorite pickups are Gretsch-style. I have all of those, except the Super Hilo's, which I only had for the short time that I had a G5622T. I should have kept the Super Hilo's when I sold the guitar, except that it was a return, so no-no, no can do.  It was an impressive guitar and I liked the pickups, but it was a bit duplicative for me and I decided to let it go back.
All of my Gretsch-style pickups are in Fenders and Gibsons, though, except for my one Gretsch G6119T. They are awesome pickups in Fenders and Gibsons (replacing humbuckers).
Question for you... if one wishes to get more highs from a Filter'tron or a TVJ Classic, neck pickup, how would you set the pickup height and how would you set the different rows of screw height?
Pictures?
This was the 5622 that I returned - loved the walnut color - looking at the photo, now I'm really regretting letting it go! Korean. Super Hilo's. JEEZ.
TV Jones TV-HT Hilo'trons in my ES-339
Gretsch Hilo'tron in my Jade Pearl American Standard
I could go on, but should probably spare you from the deluge.

Aside from raising the pickup so that it's closer to the plain string and further from the wound ones, I don't think there is much to be done physically. The Filter'tron / TV Classic has a super high resonant peak, so the treble is there, the reason they aren't as bright as you'd expect is because the eddy currents caused by the large steel screws roll the high end off, and that gives them a bass quality they'd otherwise lack. The Magne'trons are basically Filter'trons without the eddy current losses, and they have quite a cutting high end. A member on here rigatele / stratotars experimented with replacing the Filter'tron's screws with ones of varying carbon content that don't cause as great of eddy currents https://www.strat-talk.com/threads/cap-screw-mod-for-fender-fidelitron.405461/ , that's an easy mod but it changes the appearance of the pickup.
Electrically, putting a cap in series with the neck pickup also rolls the bass down, leaving treble more prominent. I think 22nF and 47nF tone caps work in that capacity. I'd also make sure the guitar has 500k pots, because of the high eddy current losses, I'd say they're a must. You could pair Filter'tron's with 1 meg and no-load and they'd still never be as bright as a Magen'tron.

So, you don't think that lowering the pickup, but raising the screws on the bridge side of the pickup would make much difference?
Can you use screw heights on the bridge side, or on the neck side, of a Filter'tron, to shift the tone quality a bit brighter or warmer?
Also, I've heard that Magnatrons do have a much brighter character than Filter'trons or Classics. I may need to try a Magnatron neck, just for sheets and giggles.

I raised the pole pieces on my Setzer and it did make trebles more pronounced - but mostly by rebalancing lows and mods lower.
Raising the pickups and dropping the poles pushed output up without reducing highs.

Thank you. That's a really interesting thread! Now, I really want to do some threaded pole piece experiments!
So, lowering the pickup and raising the pole pieces (so more of the poles sit above the magnet, rather than below) should have something of a similar effect as shortening the pole pieces, right?
On a neck Filter'tron, what would you expect the result to be from shortening the pole pieces on the bridge side of the pickup, but not on the neck side? Much different than shortening all 12?
I love that color green. It pisses me off that Adorama won't ship tp Hawaii. I used to have a Cherry colored late 60s Tennessean with HiLo'Trons and in the early 70s I loaned it to a guy I thought was my best friend and he traded it for drugs. And I've never had another good Gretsch since then.

The neck side screws of the neck pickup are usually blind to the 4th harmonic because the node is right in that spot, so raising the screws that are bridge side increases the 4th harmonic output. The 4th harmonic content is definitely "treble".
A lot of neck pickups, like a Tele neck pickup, are especially bass-heavy because they're position up against the neck under a 4th harmonic node. 24 fret guitars usually don't have this issue because the extended frets push the whole pickup closer to the bridge, but on the down side, it's not just more treble, it's a different timbre. Adjusting any particular harmonic amplitude, as opposed to the overall frequency response, changes the timbre.

I put them in a Cabronita, which doesn't have a tone control, it was brutal. I put a concentric pot in there and made one part of it a tone control.

I have a parts guitar build with a Strat neck pickup that more or less resides where it would be if it had a 24 fret neck, and IMO, it sounds a lot like a (standard positioned) Strat neck and middle pickup in parallel. Since it's just a 21 fret neck with a chewed up body, I've thought about relocating the neck pickup closer to where it would exist originally.
...I'd say the timbre makes it tend to work better for cleaner and less overdriven sounds, where bass-heavy characteristics can be kind of detrimental. But it tends to sound unorthodox when using more overdriven sounds, because higher frequencies tend to be too prominent, at least for my tastes.

Antigua, could the classic metal cover of the Filter'tron also have something to do with it? I have TV Jones filtertrons but with a plastic p90 like cover and they seem really bright.

I've been experimenting with lowering pickups and raising the bridge-side pole pieces on my Filter'tron, Hilo'tron, and Fideli'tron NECK pickups. There definitely seems to be something to bringing the pole pieces farther up from the magnets, in terms of enhancing the highs. Pretty cool!

A little bit, but rigatale measured a Filter'tron clone and found that the eddy currents mostly owed to the screws rather than the cover. The open top of the cover helps reduce eddy currents there.

These Super HiLo'trons are actually humbuckers, a lot like a PAF style humbucker, with one row of screws and one with slugs, and a slim sized AlNiCo 5 bar. That's the end of the similarity though, the inductance of the Super HiLo'tron is very low, less than half of a PAF, and very much like a typical Filter'tron.

First, Thank you so, so much for the analysis. These pickups aren't very common, and info is even more rare, since most every thread about them, including this one, seems to almost instantly get hijacked by the same Filtertron vs. HiLo'Tron discussion. These aren't Hilo'Trons, folks. Different animal altogether, and looking back, they might have been the biggest single thing that turned me to a Gretsch guy. I was looking for an new, affordable-ish 335 type guitar, but a G5622T-CB Electromatic stood way out, tone-wise, a lot of which, a lot of which I attribute to the sparkle of these pickups. The G5622T-CB is a different guitar, most significantly, mine has three Super Hilo's, with an extra volume knob, and an on-off switch for the middle one. They are considerably brighter than a lot of humbuckers, but I don't know if I don't really think they sound single-coil, like a lot of folks claim. For one, uhh, no hum. They are a slightly lower output, than a lot of hummers, but it's not really the kind of instrument most players choose if they're struggling to get enough chug from their Bogner Uberschall. Also, there was a lot of room to adjust them closer to the strings.
From a purely aesthetic perspective, there's no denying those Filter'Trons are classy looking, but I kinda prefer my milky-white mounts vs. your aged, and, unlike some, I love the vintage cat's eye holes in my body.
Acoustic fingerpicking
So how do you do it? I have arrived at bare-finger picking after abandoning finger/thumb picks and fingernails. So now I have callouses on my right fingers as well as my left fingers.
I learned a lot of my fingerpicking technique and patterns from listening to and practicing along with Gordon Lightfoot, Jim Croce, and John Prine to name a few.
I took up fingerpicks when I started playing banjo 40 years ago, then I transferred them to guitar. That worked pretty well, but there are still some limitations, i.e., the fingerpicks can only be used in one direction.
Then I had carpal tunnel surgery on my right hand, one surgery for the thumb and forefinger, and a separate surgery for the middle finger.
After that, my middle finger just couldn't do the finger pick any more; it wouldn't go at the proper speed, so I couldn't do 3-finger picking with that contraption on my finger.
Interestingly, that finger works fine without a finger pick. So I thought "I'll just grow out my own fingernails and use them."
Well, after fiddle-farting around with my fingernails, I finally decided to cut my nails short on my picking fingers and just build up callouses like a bass player.
This is working very well for me, and unlike with fingerpicks, I can pluck the strings in both directions, because I like doing back-handed downstrokes with my fingers/nails.
I'm not a big fingerpicker in the true sense, I wish I was. But I have hybrid picked for decades.
Lately for a couple years now I have started fingerpicking more with no pick, mostly because I'm playing more acoustic now and because I just do it here in the office learning songs or etc.
I really do like it. Different tone nuances are definitely available with it, even on electric.
I discovered playing the duo (just one guitar) that I can get near Jaco tones on the bass end.... accidentally discovered that.
I'm far better playing solo fingerpicking because I do the bass lines better with my thumb free.
I need to actually do it some time live instead of falling back to the flat pick. Trouble is, I'm not as fast fingerpicking, but probably more tasteful.
Basically only finger pick on acoustics. Can't bond with thumb or finger picks, so I wear out the pads of my hand. A delta blues player doing it the cheap way, but I admire Son House and his use of thumb and finger picks.
I started as a banjoist, so thumb and finger picks were what I was used to, but for some reason, I couldn’t keep playing that way. I switched to fingernails (what my guitar teacher used), but couldn’t keep them in usable condition. By default, I ended up with just my fingertips. I have played acoustic that way for 40 years, including my 12 string.
I'm a finger picker, period. I finger pick my electrics, resonators, 12 strings and even "strum" with just nails. Experimented with thumb and metal finger picks and gave up. I use the fleshy part of my thumb with no nail, but a combination of flesh and nails on my fingers. I mostly play with two fingers but add the third for some arpeggios - and while fingers are more or less dedicated to strings, they do move around as required. I keep my nails slightly longer than the tips of my fingers (except when I break one, I do a bit of rock climbing and gardening and other things that are hard on nails). I've experimented with CA to repair nails, didn't think it worked very well. Never tried acrylics.
There are lots of sub styles of "finger picking", mine is based on the old delta blues with thumb playing more or less alternating bass, fingers picking out a melody. I've been heavily influenced by John Fahey, Leo Kottke and some of the more modern finger style players. I don't sing and I don't play with others so my right hand has to do it all.
Probably some of the best instructional materials were the old Stefan Grossman blues lessons, however there is a lot to be said for learning classical technique. Classical of course is much more rigid - fingers are assigned to different strings and patterns, hand position and techniques are much more formal.
Another "bare flesh" fingerpicker here. Can't sing, gotta make the guitar do it for me!
I've recently gotten into Travis picking and find that it seems to come pretty naturally to me. I do need to work on a song for a couple of weeks to get the patterns down smooth. I like the Jim Kelly Speed Picks for thumb and use my fingernails. I haven't tried finger picks yet, but I have used them for pedal steel, so I guess I should give them a try on the acoustic.
jerrysguitarbar.com has some good John Prine and Townes Van Zandt lessons.
One way to begin integrating fingerstyle into your acoustic playing... just take it one finger at a time and work your way through the history of fingerstyle steel string acoustic players. Steel string acoustics have only been around for like 100 years, you might be surprised at how quickly you can begin to wrap your mind around the entirety of the repertoire.
I started with thumb dexterity exercises then moved to other fingers, one at a time. "Dead Thumb" technique is used by lots of the earlier generations of acoustic, rural bluesmen. Think Big Bill Broonzy or Lightning Hopkins.
Being able to move from dead-thumbing (pounding away on 1 string like a drone) to alternating bass will require some string skipping technique with the thumb. Pull up a cowboy chord E minor and pluck with your thumb on 6, 4, 2 then 5, 3, 1. You gotta find some way to dial in that thumb's muscle memory.
The "Delta Claw Grip" I've heard described as playing with solely thumb and index finger. I associate Robert Johnson with this style of playing, altho I think he used more than 2 fingers quite often. Evolving from the claw grip, you start to get into the 2 finger versions of the Piedmont blues. Opposed to the delta claw grip, this style incorporates more ragtime syncopations. Less pinching and more alternate thumbing, IME. Think of Etta Baker's "Carolina Breakdown."
With 3 fingers (thumb, index and middle) ya might wanna watch some Mississippi John Hurt. He braced his pinky and ring finger on the guitar and used 3 fingers to play in a Piedmont Blues style. By this point you've also got guys in the Blues-Folk revival like John Fahey and Leo Kottke to check out using lots of 3 finger techniques. Some of Leo's techniques sound like 2 fingers to me (think of that opening riff of "Vasoline Machine Gun"), but I'm pretty sure he uses more than that quite often.
By the time you feel comfortable using 4 or 5 fingers, ya might as well start learning some Tommy Emmanuel! =)

I do the exact same - good to know I’m not alone - I thought I was weird! Well, I am I guess but I’m not the only one at least.
whoa - too many choices!
just posted on Bad Dog about my visit to the toystore and first purchase of thumbpicks...
Like the dog that chases cars, I've got no idea what to do w/ these little loops of Delrin (or whatever they are made of)
Will probably be visiting here a bit to try to learn what happens After I leave the store.
Look, out Chet Atkins. . .
I have my nails short and play half nail half flesh when picking the strings.
I find that fingerpicking with flesh sounds better on my electrics. When my nails are acoustic length, my acoustic guitars sound best. I’ve trued to use Finger picks, up never got th3 hang of it over 40+ years.
I suck at it. That's all I can contribute to this conversation.
I'm another flesh only guy with callouses (40 yrs). Suits me just fine.
I do the standard Piedmont-style, alternating bass fingerpicking. I use thumb and middle and index fingers. Middle finger plays the high E string. Index finger plays the B and G strings. Thumb plays the low E, A and D strings.
I have fingernails on the index and middle fingers. Not as long as classical players have. I usually use just bare flesh on the thumb, but occasionally use a thumb pick, especially if I want to mute the bass strings with the heel of my palm. I can't get the angle to play the bass strings with the thumb and mute with the heel of the palm at the same time. I need the extra length of the thumb pick.
Because I don't normally use the thumb pick, I find that when I do start using it it takes me a few days to get used to it.
I’m predominantly a Travis-picker when I play with my fingers, though it depends on what I’m playing. And I don’t do much of that when I pick up an electric, that’s mainly an acoustic thing for me.
Finger picking is at the core of the style of almost all guitarists who use the technique. I decided one day I needed to learn, so my style is a little unorthodox. I mostly use three fingers, my thumb, index, and ring fingers. They seem to fall the most naturally on the strings. I use my middle finger too occasionally, more often for stops than anything else. I don't Travis pick. I use my thumb to start an arpeggio and use my long fingers to finish it, for stops, and for lead lines. I play solos off chords, so in a typical song three or four fingers get a workout. My finger style sounds more like what a pianist would play than a typical guitarist, but it works for me. I play a jazz number thumb only. I can't explain how I can play fast thumb only but it's what the piece calls for. I'm perfectly happy to let my right hand do some of the work with hammer ons, pull offs, and slides. I do this on electric and acoustic guitars. I use a flat pick on some songs for attack and tone, but I've been playing finger so long now, that I have to make a conscious effort when using a flat pick. I don't even think about what I'm doing when I play finger style. My mix is mostly country and country influenced with the occasional instrumental jazz number, and a few other numbers that I just like to play. Rereading the OP, I don't use finger nails. In fact I file the nails on my right hand to prevent them from affecting timbre. I could probably do OK without using my middle finger at all and one day if the arthritis gets bad enough, I may need to learn to play with four fingers on each hand.
Considering all this, I'd like to learn classical, or at least classical technique. I'm playing off chords now. I'd like to work from sheet music and learn to play single note solos in the classical style. Playing the same material the same way gets old. I started with jazz to learn modes. The Dorian mode with its landing notes and loops has found its way into other stuff I play. Learning the classical style can't hurt. No one ever did better knowing less.
I like using flesh with nail but my nails are bad. Regular finger picks don't work for me but these aLaska picks are working great. They wrap the fingertip and hook under the nail
I been a few years getting the Chet Atkins picking style down, I recently discovered you can practice the technique without a guitar, the thumb movements after many hours come without thinking about it.
Twang, Spank, Quack - What else, and what do these mean?
These words are used to describe "Tele sounds", and likely a few other words. They all may well mean different things to different people.
1) What other words have you heard used?
2) What do these words mean to you?
To me, Twang has to do with the way different overtone frequencies come to the fore as the sound decays after the attack. First, there's a quick development of higher overtones, then those higher overtones settle away at a different rate than the other overtones in the sound. It sounds different on wound vs unwound strings, but it's still got that same characteristic. It's akin to a more subtle version of a "Kerang!" or "Meow" sound, where the sound has two parts with different frequencies emphasized. The attack has certain frequency attributes, and the decay has different frequency attributes, and where they cross over and change makes the Twang sound. If the sound were made on a synthesizer, you might create a quick attack, and then crank the high-pass filter down as the sound decays to emphasize those different overtones.
To me, Spank has to do with the quality of the attack - the first part of the sound. It's snappy, sharp and quick. Part of what makes up first part, the attack, of the Twang.
I have no idea exactly what people mean by Quack, but I bet it's related to that two-part, different frequency decay that I think of when I think of Twang.
There. I got all that off my chest. I feel better now.
Simply put quack is the Mark Knopfler sound. Twang is Duane Eddy. I dont know spank beyond politics - which cant be mentioned

IMO, Twang is when the string vibrates unhindered by fret rattle or pick-up pull, but is fighting the vibration dampening tendencies of instruments with less than optimum acoustic characteristics, and adding the elusive, ill-defined mojo of a slight bow in the neck, which mixes some magic into the sound via a pitch that can change timbre, but remains in tune through the entire period of the note.
Spank is when the neck is a little too straight, but the strings barely have enough tension to remain unfettered, so, with a light touch, the strings vibrate a bit wildly, that is, in a broader ellipse than normal, giving a sound that contains a "consonant" element before the vowel sound, which will have a bit of pitch flexibility before it decays.
Quack is a function of pick-up phase.

Yes. That.
I prefer my telecasters to have sprong over twang or spank. And I like a nice prindley tone in my Strats....
Spank = Attack, punch. a touch Compressed. .....to me. Gretsch comes to mind. But Tele bridge pickup gets there too.
Twang is what I hear when I play unplugged. Rigging up turns it into skree and krrrang.
I would equate Quack more with a Strat (in position 2 or 4).
here's what I think of as "twang"
the tele in this is "spanky" (twang + compression)
"quack" I think of as the nasally twang you get from a strat, like this:
Buzzwords and nothing more.
It’s like the favourite neck that plays like butter, spent a few hundred bucks on one from Warmoth and it just melted and squashed in my hands.
CS ‘69’s sound glassy; WTF is that?! When the glass is scratched or when a brick is thrown though it?
... is the sound made when a duck is launched from a giant bow.
thats usually the sound I make when I pluck my nose hairs!
Twang, spank , quack
another one bites the dust!
what ...TMI?
Twang--Duane Eddy, Pete Anderson
Spank--Jimmie Vaughan, Kid Ramos
Quack--Mark Knopler, Robert Cray
My telecaster barks.
Musical SIXS versus musical HALF-DOZENS!
And remember, a good neck pickup sounds "woody".
distortion or fuzz that "fizzes"
anybody got a video for that?
I get "glassy" when it comes to amps with hot tubes, a beautiful thing
I have had many lovers over the years.
Some of them preferred to call what we did 'love-making'.
Loving.
Pleasant idle, stolen moments.
Some simply 'f#%king'.
Others, 'scrogging'.
One of my wives would ask me kindly if I "wanted a poke" when I appeared to be randy.
The names and nomenclature really don't matter.
Our passions and our ardent pursuit of pleasure, tone, and perfection don't really have to have a quantifiable tag-line or a monicker.
Twang, spank, quack, wonk, ding, cha-ching batta-bing, it's all good.
These are just expressions and terms designed to define a common-understanding of a feeling and a sound.
They are merely feeble human attempts at describing that which cannot be put into words.
In then end, it's just rockin' and rollin'.
A musical and sexual expression that binds us all, I think.
I'm gonna shut up now.
Twang: high-pitched sound
Quack: position 2 and 4 (even 3) on a Strat
Spank: compressed clean sound

Eh...you know it when you hear it! Not much help, I know....
Part of "spank" is in the technique—spanking the strings—but the right spanky pickups and low action help.
I’ve never liked the word “quack” when used to describe out of phase strat positions... that sound always sounded more like a “cluck” to me.
Quack is such a midrange forward vowel sound. Cluck seems more midscooped and restrained.

While reading through these, I was thinking "quack" was what many refer to that Mark Knopfler sound was, but I, too, had always thought of it as "cluck". But I do think a lot of terms like these are different things to different people....often used in a "more in the know than you" way.
My Tele howls. My Gretsch plunks and dunks. My Jazzmaster has a beard and goes plink-plink-plink.
Spank: Slight delayed reaction from the bass response, accompanied by an almost mechanical treble “slap” sound....
Quacky is most often heard when one uses the 5-way Strat switch in positions #2 or #4. This is the neck and middle or the Bridge and middle pickups together in a sort of out-of-phase sound. These tones are what make Stratocasters famous. Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits uses this tone a lot, like on the song Sultans Of Swing, as a classical example. In country music this is the Twangy tone used for many tunes. And in Funk music this same hollow Twangy sound is used as well.
Onomatopoeia.
Well, as follows for me:
- Teles twang
- Strats quack
- SG's bite
- Les pauls roar
The spanking thing is a private matter though...

So far, this is the best answer to me. I would venture to add that the order is: twang, quack, SPANK
Braang. Forgot braang. Very important is braang. It's what a first position E chord does, and it's the only one that goes 'braang'.
Spank is the desirable version of fret slap, that can occur when you pull and release the strings towards the fretboard, so they slap the frets. You can force it with any action. It becomes a nuisance with action that is too low, and accompanies buzzing.
Quack vs Cluck..whats next, crow and cackle lol? I agree its the 2 and 4 positions on a strat, the center position on a tele. And definitely components of chicken pickin...
"Ching" - the chimy ring that comes from crunchy humbucker/filtertrons a la Malcom Young.
"Twank" - the banjo like quick decay twang. Not exactly twang+spank, but related. Perhaps a less aggressive spank, where some twang sneaks thru before being choked into a transitional twanggg-k sound. Produced with a hammer-on followed by a partial pull-off. A staccato hammer-on might be another way to accomplish twank.
I got mine to Twerk.
Quack to me is the Tele middle switch position or Strat 2nd switch position, tone turned up full through a clean channel
Twang - Gretsch; Tele neck tone all the way up moderate Reverb
Spank - Tele bridge with tone at 3/4
I prefer clang
Sounds like the words from the colorbursts in the fights on the old Batman teevee show: SPANK!  QUACK!  TWANG!
I could use some help with these definitions too… I don’t have a girlfriend.
”Twang, Spank, Quack - What else, and what do these mean?”
It sure aint snap, crackle, pop
"purr" refers to Teenie Hodges. (Al Green)

https://www.guitarworld.com/artists/video-bruce-springsteen-and-tom-morello-perform-van-halens-jump
Have a friend who's been trying to turn me onto him for years. I recently asked him for six or seven 'deep cuts' and he gave me a pretty good playlist, but it all seems so bombastic and tightly focused on an era/area I just can't relate to.
on another forum I often read, the Springsteen freaks often remark about what a fantastic guitar player he is, a real hero of the telecaster.
I bet this wont even make a dent in that mythology.....
I think if you had been with me on august 5th, 1978, you would never wonder at springsteen's appeal ever again.
My brother despises him. I saw him in Miami in 76 right before he made Time mag.
I thought his best song was his tribute to Mitch Ryder.
I think he is a good or great neighborhood band that did good. Nothing more, nothing less.
imho
I never quite understood how a kid from the Jersey Shore contracted a back woods Smokey Mountain accent.
I really like Tom Morello as a guitarist and I can get along with most of Bruce Springsteen's music - though it's less to my taste than RATM and Audioslave.
I saw Springsteen's "Musicares" bash on TV and really enjoyed Tom's guitar work. Personally, I don't have any issue with anyone performing covers of other artists' work. Some will like it, some won't.
There's always other channels to watch, or the "off" switch.

It was alright. I actually liked The River.
But as the years went by, in my opinion, things went rapidly.... into something I had no interest in, and in a direction that I often felt contempt towards.
For example, I got up and left the viewing area about halfway thru his Super Bowl thing. Ugh.
There actually is someone who sings Jump worse than DLR.
Bruce solo at 2:40
Forgotten gem among the hundreds he's written (None of the Franky/Johnny/Billy songs ever gave me the chills and I could live a hundred lifetimes w/out hearing Thunder Road or Born To Run again.)
Saw the E-STreet band about 2009? Somewhere around there. One of the most powerful live bands I've seen, if not the most. If you don't like bombast, ok, I get it. But to me, rock SHOULD be bombastic. Give me Queen, give me 'Bat out of Hell', give me 'Anarchy in the UK' or 'Blitzkrieg Bop'. When the guitar solo cuts in during 'Born To Run'... bliss....
Your mileage may vary. And that's fine.
I own two albums out of obligation. To much bombast and production for me. Ramone’s are not bombastic to me. Impactful.

I have a long and complicated and sometimes borderline insane relationship with his music. but I will admit that in the interviews I've seen or read with him over the past 20 years or so, I saw a very smug sort of fellow. I doubt I would enjoy meeting him.
but if I had written "thunder road" and about 25 others in that league, i'd probably think very highly of myself, too
I was a big fan until I heard him live. I saw him on the "Radio" tour-the last one with the intact E-Street Band. Federici would soon pass. He was more than an hour late. As soon as he started, the crowd went nuts. It became clear that much like a Beatles show in the early '60s, folks were not really listening. If they were they would have heard a miserable mix that I kept waiting for it to be corrected-but it never was. Had I not paid way too much, I would have left. Still there are works of his that border on the remarkable-Nebraska, Tunnel of Love, the Tom Joad record are great works IMHO. I can't get the concert experience out of my head. I saw Steve Earle about a month after and he really blew Bruce away. I understand the attraction. My appreciation has certainly been tempered, but I listen to him.
BS is the most over-rated performer since Elvis, IMO.
At best, he's a decent song writer, again, just my opinion.
Like the big E, he is also immensely popular.
More for y'all, I reckon.

What happened on Aug 5, 1978? Did he just get back from a shopping trip at GC?
I grew up in Southern Connecticut and was exposed to a ton of the Boss in the 70's as he was rising through the ranks and stuff....and then I just didn't enjoy it.
These days? I enjoy his music much more. I have tunes that I love...Tunnel of Love, Tenth Ave. Freeze Out, Thunder Road, Rosalita, Prove it all night, Adam Raised a Cane...pretty much select old tunes.

Big rivalry there, mostly on Bruces part.
Earle can out Bruce Bruce every day and twice on sundays.
His version of "Santa Claus is Coming to the Darkness on the Edge of Town" was unusual to say the least.
Seriously though my college roommate one year was huge fan and I overdosed on BS after the first week. His friend with an endless supply of bootlegs did not help. "Adam Raised a Cain" I thought was OK, along with other darker material, but his "regular guy" schtick got a bit annoying IMO. The early stuff with way too many words and Crazy Janey and Digital Larry and all these characters didn't really catch me either.

Well, go figure.
I think Springsteen has coped amazingly well with so much notoriety, and has probably changed less since he was 15 that 90% of people of our generation have. The guy seems to be at peace with himself, and when he says something, normally I can process it as basic fact - so many celebrities, you just can't.
I'm very happy that his music swept you away. It never did that for me. Structurally, all the elements are there, but I don't get that supernatural lift I can see happening to others. I know the lift, because I get it watching Neil Young or Van Morrison or Bob Dylan or Mavis Staples or Robert Cray, but Bruce's thing just doesn't deliver any for me. But I can see it working magic on others, so he'll get my respect until he turns into a fool - and he hasn't yet.

I thought Morello and Vedder sounded great....
I love the guy. Got into him about when Born to Run hit and then went back and fell totally in LOVE with his first two albums. Saw him twice when he was touring on Darkness in 78 and they'll always be two of the most memorable, high energy, dance party good times I'll ever have. Saw him in '80 after the River in Tempe the night after the election - that's turned out to be a legendary show but I was in a really bad place that night and didn't enjoy it much at all. Then I saw him in '84 with my then girlfriend, now wife, and it was phenomenal. She wasn't a fan at all, but fell in love with him that night and has been ever since. Saw him after Tunnel of Love in '88 and didn't love it (although I dug the album, but no E-street band, no sale live). And once in the early 90's after those Lucky Town albums - also pretty bad. Then didn't see him again until the early 2000s with the re-united E-Street band and they were incredible again. Saw him most recently in 2013 and he was great but somewhere during that concert it just felt like he was an old man trying way too hard to seem young. Maybe I was just projecting. Haven't been to see him since - don't like the crowds and I think I've seen the last of the big epic rock shows I'm ever gonna go fight the crowds to see. Used to love them, but it's all over now!
I still love everything through Tunnel of Love and not much since. Hugely respect him as a songwriter and a performer. Still like his first two albums more than anything since, as great as some of the stuff since has been. Because I think those first two albums were really HIM, about HIS life, just telling stories that were real to him. After that, he started trying to be something he wasn't and it's a credit to him that he did it as amazingly well as he did - most of his best songs were from that Born to Run through Born in the USA albums. But they never felt as real to me as the first two. And then Tunnel of Love also felt really genuine and lived in to me - it was about HIM again, just a guy going through the painful breakup of a marriage - not epic tales of a blue collar life he'd hadn't lived in years and never would again, just an emotionally broken guy.
Great songwriter, great performer, great singer at times, more that adequate guitarist for the material. And he was happening at a point in my life where I was really ready for him. I can imaging if you didn't like his politics you could get really sick of him really quick - I get that, it's happened to me with some artists. But I like his politics so that was never a problem for me...

imo and estimation springsteen is a lot like bob dylan in that if it weren't for his lyrics - there wouldn't be much there... however his lyrics w/o his voice - well I'm not sure that'd work either. nebraska, my hometown, murder inc, badlands, atlantic city, born to run, born in the usa - theses are really good examples of lyrics.
similar to bob d - is he a great singer: eh. is he a great guitarist: eh. are his lyrics better than 99.9% of the drivel out there: absolutely.
I put Bruce in the same category as the Beatles, Elvis and REM.
I absolutely dig 1/2 of their material...but the stuff I don't dig, I detest...not dislike, not indifferent...DETEST.
Springsteen has some great songs and even some great albums, but one-half of his material is like an ice pick to the taint.
I've not gone to see him live for that reason.
I dislike Morello in his various incarnations, but I'd give him a chance within this new situation.

I think that Bruce Springsteen is basically just a really decent human being, and this IMO buys him a huge amount of traction with the general public and we don't feel bad for having a luke warm experience attending his shows or listening to his recordings. Yes, he's made an absolutely HUGE pile of money, but he's good people, tries to help others and so we never begrudge him that.
It might seem like Johnny and Dee Dee and Joey came up from a similar set of circumstances and we'd be obliged to give them the benefit of the doubt, that the music is so one dimensional (1.75 for Dee Dee) and that the enterprise is so blatantly commercial, except for the evident fact that The Ramones cared about the Ramones and pretended I guess, love for their fans, but as for Humankind, the Ramones really put their money were their mouths were, didn't they? They're bums, as human beings, and I guess the only good thing about them was they didn't try to disguise the fact that they had no goals for society, and had no higher principles. Let me do what I wanna do, and get rich in the process.
More important things than whether the show seems bombastic or not.

right, he is no where near the bob d that bob d isn't. Huge memory embalmer here so...
also, must have been a very demure dj
I have a few albums , ( I like the first two ) and a concert video, not a big fan, but he seems a interesting person, I found the AB to be a good read, obviously when you are a major personality you can engage in revisionist history and have the help of powerful-talented people during the writing/editing process but most folks have at least a basis in reality when publishing such things.
Man worked hard in difficult circumstances, he became what he wanted, a professional rock musician. He never wavered from that path, I admire that.
As for the surprising amount of negative vibe about his work, I dislike many artistic creations/movements etc., as well as many people.
I reserve stronger emotions for more egregious violations of the human spirit.
Just like Glenn died with a broken heart, that he and the Eagles were so hated by the internet masses, I can't imagine Bruce being able to plod through another day after reading these opinions...
I actually like his politics more than I do his music.

I'd put it at a shockingly high number. Even early cast-offs like "If I Fell" are incredibly deep melodically/structurally and a lot of time, lyrically ("If I Fell" gets pretty amazing when sung with unchanged lyrics by a woman). And once you get past '66, they're simply unassailable imo. Changed music and the world.
Allow me to jump into this one...
I entered my 20's in 1973, in southern New Jersey, a short hop from Asbury Park, the stomping ground of The Boss and his E Street Band.
While I am not a fan of the music, I have a tremendous amount of respect for the band's showmanship, musicianship and longevity, and for their dedication to their fan base.
The Boss and his E Street band play music which resonates with the working man (and woman), and while not everyone is a fan, everyone knows the music.
My $.02.
I like his songs about cars and girls, but I'll admit I like him a little less after watching that performance of "Jump" (which, incidentally, is the reason I stopped buying Van Halen's records). Twice in a row, Bruce??? Good gawd. Had I been at that show, I probably would have taken a hostage.
After witnessing that steaming pile, I couldn't bring myself to click on the "Highway to Hell" video.
Actually this is pretty good, despite his limited vocal range he does not butcher this:
except he doesn't know the lyrics "London is clowning around", but that's not too bad, still a respectable version.
He also doesn't butcher Jump, but it would be pretty hard to make it sound worse than the original.

This.
4 reasons Bruce has the stature he has:
1. Born to Run LP
2. Darkness on the Edge of Town LP...especially for Tele devotees
3. The River LP
Born in the USA LP...not my fave
Add Rosalita(!) and Sandy and E Street Shuffle from his second LP, plus marathon live performances that just kill (buy the 1975-1985 set) and you have the makings of a rock and roll savior. I will admit, after BITUSA he lost me until the Promise album outtakes from 1977, but I saw the 2016 River Tour and all was made right again.
He is a fave for me just because of items 1-4 above, plus live. I don’t dig his current stuff...I didn’t even enjoy the Rising...but no one was better from 1975-1985.
Tom Morello just gets on my nerves. I don’t get Bruce’s infatuation with him and his playing.
Give me Bruce’s snarling Tele on Darkness any day.
Why don't you guys heap scorn on the Backstreet Boys, Nickelback, or one of the thousands and thousands of crap bands that have made it big? Why single out The Boss, John Mayer, and so on? Just to demonstrate your superior taste? Plus, just in general, the critics stance of blah blah blah he sucks etc. - save it. Be a musician yourself, go out and write better tunes if you can, criticism is cheap and lazy. Personally I don't listen to a lot of the Boss, but I have to respect the body of work. I think any musician would.
With any musician/music, there are going to be those who love them, hate them, or could care less about them either way. Regardless of what they play or do if you don't like them you are not going to change your opinion.
I do like Springsteen. One of the great things about Springsteen is that he puts a lot into his live performances and tries to put on a show that his fans will enjoy. Along with that he will perform covers that are sometimes great sometimes not so great. I think he picks covers that he thinks the fans will like but also because he likes performing them. He doesn't take himself too seriously, he has fun and his fans have fun. If you are a fan he puts on a great live show, I was at one that was getting pretty close to 4 hours long. Its great if you are a fan but if you're not, you're in for a long night.
Wow,pulling out a couple of tossed off covers to slam an artist ,pretty weak.
If you'd picked one of his songs that would've been different.
I think he’s a decent song writer, and has a good band and not a fan of wives in the band. He talks to much during his shows, very impressed with himself. I don’t like going to a concert and hearing some millionaires political views. If someone gave me tickets, I’d give them to someone who wanted to see him. Born in the USA and being a draft dodger - a tad hipacritical.
saw him in the 70's and early 80's. Loved his interview in the Chuck Berry movie... it made me really like 'him'... I saw another documentary that made me think that he is very driven (in a good way) to make music... he has kept a very large band together and attracted (and not been threatened by) solo artists who preferred to be in his band than to stay solo... He has written so many really great songs... I don't listen to him often... but, man, one step up, two steps back... dang... I always thought Waylon or George Jones shoulda done a version...
As for the 'jump' thing... man, there are a couple of videos of me playing like ass on the internet... with that many thousands of gigs, there will be some bad ones of almost anyone...

I’m not sure I follow. I just reread the previous posts to find the heaping piles of scorn, and I don’t see it. Some stated he’s not their cup of tea, but just quickly pointed out they respect his work. Actually, my comment about Bob Dylan comparison being an insult to Bob was one of the worst and even then, that’s only because to me, BD is gawd like.
In fact, I saw E Street back in the 80s and I totally get why is so loved. It’s nice to see someone passionate about something, however.
Springsteen's gotta be the most brutal guitarist I've ever seen. Just as well he plays a Telecaster otherwise there'd be splinters and shattered plastic littering the stage floor.

I agree that Bruce is over-rated as a musician, but keep in mind, he is selling a Personality : handsome working-class hero with a compelling story to tell. He has a great troubadour persona, and is just really likeable. I can't get past that his vocal intonation is heinous, so even though his voice has a pleasing timbre, he sings so out-of-tune, I can't listen to him for long.
Elvis had a great resonant tone, and very good intonation and rock-a-billy phrasing, so they really can only be compared as good-looking recording artists. Also, Elvis didn't do a lot of song writing. He was a very good singer, though. Different strokes.
Here's a good (but tongue in cheek) version of the Van Halen commercial product:
But, I think Roddy made a career mistake, releasing this. Some fans thought it was a Sell Out and other fans didn't like what they saw as a dig at Eddie and David Lee. At least the LP version has the Huge Electric Guitar Freak Out at the end. Missing here, sorry about that.
I was going to bring in the Aztec Camera version, but someone beat me to it. I like that version.

My take on Springsteen as a songwriter: Very talented, but not as prolific as he could be and doesn't have a clue about editing. He has some masterpieces, but loses credibility by putting out/performing/mugging for the audience on some very crap material. "Mary's Place?" That type of stuff is not something that I can listen to more than once and once is painful enough. He has tons of that crap. A lot of people like it.

I saw him play Thunder Road twice in a row when he brought Bob Seger up on the stage in Ann Arbor in the early '80's. I though it was embarrassing. I also saw him in '76 which I thought was priceless. By the time '78 rolled around he seemed to be programmed for commercialism though.
I do find it interesting that in his very early days he was a jam guitarist and very decent IMHO. I think that he can do some things with accomplished musicality. He never seems to have a handle on knowing what is good and what is way over the top self indulgent though. That is a turn off for me.
He’s written some good songs but man the bombast is just tiresome. Everything blown up to EPIC. It’s like a caricature of the things he writes about.
I first caught wind of Bruce when I was 15 years old, right when Darkness on the Edge of Town was released. Impressionable NJ teenager discovers NJ rock and roller on the upswing and working the same psychic ground, and so was hooked. Still love his earlier, more obscure music from around the time of his first two records, when he first veered away from his earlier proto-heavy metal roots (Steel Mill) into more lyrical and melodic territory, discovering his inner Dylan and Van Morrison (no coincidence there as he disbanded Steel Mill after seeing a Van show and realizing he wanted some of that), and teaming up with the incredible David Sancious on piano to give things a loose, jazzy, melodic feel that we'd never hear again after Sancious left to do his own thing, before Born to Run. That's when Bruce was at his best IMO, and with all the great bootlegged unreleased and live material from those days have never felt a strong need to see him live, felt like I'd already heard the best he would ever do there, though of all nights I did see him in Philly on December 8th 1980. Silent ride back home after that one.
He kinda got too big for his own britches with Darkness (something Elvis Costello of all people managed to document in a song called "Temptation" after catching a 1978 show of Bruce's in Nashville), and I liked him less and less with each record til he released Tunnel of Love, pretty mature but also stark songwriting. Then he really lost the thread with the Human Touch record, though its companion Lucky Town redeemed it some. He did start getting his mojo cooking again with the 2000 Live in NYC record and some songs on The Rising and Devils and Dust, leading to his best in almost 30 years, Magic. He really did have the magic back for that one record...

He wasn't a middle class kid by most measures. He grew up lower working class with a depressed father and he'd dealt with depression most of his life as well.Yeah, he's got more money than god now, but he didn't come up with any level of comfort.

This is pretty much my exact take on his career too, except I was about 15 when Born to Run came out and the whole Time/Newsweek legend is born stuff happened. I also find the first two albums and Tunnel of Love to be his most personal, real albums. The stuff from BTR through Born in the USA was a contrived character, singing about people he cared about but didn't really know that well. And it's a huge testament to his talent how incredibly great those albums are, but I still like the ones that felt real to his life more. I liked Magic too, best of his later stuff and a great tour on that album, but I didn't think it was anywhere close to his peak stuff. Sort of like saying Voodoo Lounge was the best Stones album since Tattoo You - yeah, but not even remotely close to their great stuff.
-Ray
I was a big Springsteen an back in the 70s... saw him twice around 'Born To Run' and he was great. I'd never seen anything like him up to that point. But he lost me sometime around 'The River' (another double album that should've been a single) and it only got worse from there. The sheer bombast of a Bruce show today is just exhausting.
Those two clips vividly illustrate that... I mean, how many musicians do you need to play rock & roll? If one guitarist is good, then five will be great, right?
And don't get me started on Morello. Ick.

Same here. Nebraska & Tom Joad, the latter I heard a live version w Morello on the radio yesterday. Dreadful. Not that I can stand RATM or AS either.
I did get a free ticket when Bruce was touring Ghost Of TJ. I figured what the hell... I enjoyed it.
All due respect OP, but you never get giddy? Let the man play around. Some of his concerts and music are just pure good rocky fun. I find his bombast boring and kinda offensive--but his great stuff truly, amazingly great. And I do like lots of his it's-fun-to-play-in-a-band stuff. Not the OP's choices per se, but Springsteen's versions of "Devil in a Blue Dress," etc., yep. Fun! Even Shakespeare wrote fart jokes, after all....
I like a lot of his music. He has some evocative lyrics that I quite enjoy. He also has a lot of stuff that I don't enjoy. I find that a lot of people seem quite militant in expressing their dislike for his music or for the man himself, as if they're being challenged about their opinion. Other people seem to want to convince everyone why they shouldn't like Springsteen, as if it's some kind of mission to correct people on their musical tastes.
It all gets quite silly, like getting upset about pineapple on pizza.
I could never understand why Born to Run kicked up such a storm over here when there were dozens of homegrown pub rock bands doing American style R&B much less self-consciously than The Boss.
I like The River (the track not the album) though. It's a very subtle suicide song.

I mean, like his music (or him [or not {or both <or neither>}]), that's all you, but I don't think a video clip is going to serve as anything other than confirmation of your own bias (which, again, you're free to have, but it is what it is). Every performer, from top to bottom, has had a horrendous performance or made cringeworthy choices, and a lot of these have been recorded.
If this was the Beatles you'd still love the Beatles, unless you don't like the Beatles, in which case you'd say "See? They suck!"

I can't respect Springsteen because of his phony "working man" shtick , I can't respect Morello because he doesn't trim the ends of his strings.
His early stuff was entertaining . Sometime past , I recall an interview with Bruce where he declared how great he is and espoused his superior intellect . Claimed that he was the smartest person in his school including the teachers , et al . Disgusting over inflated ego , I doubt that he and I could last in the same room for 5 minutes and I would be the sole source of all problems . Bottom line is that I am not worthy and I don't give a rat's pitute . Bruce is too great for me .

Yeah, for sure. The fuzzed up guitar outro was my whole reason for liking his version. I may not be remembering correctly but I thought Jump was on an EP or the b-side of a single.
I like The Boss but don't listen to him much these days. I don't listen to a lot of other old stuff I like either these days. I saw him in Brisbane touring Born In The USA, he owned the crowd and was sensational! This selfie from his Sydney show last year went viral. It doesn't look like anyone wants their money back.

I am probably a simpleton coming of age after his heyday so please take what I have to say with a grain of salt. I was drawn to a certain sense of patriotism. A certain sense of the value that comes of hard work independent of politics. A general sense that what most people judge on may not fairly represent the significance of your sacrifice and contribution to society. The Boss was never really in the "musician" or "guitar player" camp to me...he was always in the "has a point to make" camp and so I judged him accordingly. I put him in the same bucket as Dylan. Either way, he's better at all this than than I am.
I've seen him around six times. However, the last time I think was The River tour, so long time ago. I haven't listened to his later material much. Still like the older stuff though. He's always been known to do covers since the beginning. I've always liked big bands doing covers. Tom Petty is another one that comes to mind who always did covers. Saw him end with the DC5's Any Way You Want It once and it was outstanding.

Listen to this and tell me you don't like it.
I like early stuff like Blinded By The Light, Spirits In The Night, Thunder Road, and Born To Run, but not a steady diet of it. I think that Van Morrison's Wild Night is the song that BS would have killed to have written. Your mileage may vary.

The whole ubiquitous Boss mania around the time of the Born in the USA album turned me off anything Springsteen did from then on... but it didn't kill my appreciation of what came before. Those first 6 albums were at least 3-4 albums worth of a great band playing great songs.

I had a 75 Ford Granada coupe with a really good stereo for the times many years ago. I used to sit out in the garage at night and listen to Bruce on the stereo. I don't listen to him in the garage anymore, maybe it's because I have a Honda CRV now.
I'm working on Bruce's guitar technique. It's really hard to play everything between the 13th and 15th frets. Almost makes you feel like a wanker, almost. But then old Brucie don't have to play a whole lot of guitar, 'cause he got them bucks to just farm it out, hardly make a wrinkle in the scheme of thing financially for him. Because he's got Ben Affleck as his Accountant!

Was it nationalistic? If so, it was a much more depressing identity that he described than, say, This Land is Your Land. But certainly it was broadly perceived as national cheerleading, in the same way that Every Breath You Take was perceived as a sweet love song.
Me, I just didn't like that the music was so basic. The E Street Band to me was at their best doing the darker jazzier stuff like Kitty's Back or Spirit in the Night. Point Blank was not a song that bros could fist pump to.
As big as it was, Born to Run had detail, interesting changes and dynamics; in comparison, Born in the USA might as well have been Bruce rapping over a loop. Over and over. For like two years straight. Everywhere you went.
It was years before I could bear to rediscover his good stuff, and even then I wasn't inspired to check out anything newer.

Cuz he’s worthy.
I took my wife to see him a few years ago. I’m mid 40’s and she’s a few years behind me. I think we were the youngest people there. She complained that the show was so boring....and sadly I couldn’t disagree so we left.
I think he's a decent fella, but his music does absolutely nothing to me. Too plain-vanilla in structure and melody, which is why he seems to have to dress it up in bombast, posturing, over-instrumentation (like that corny "ring-ting-ting" thing I don't know the name of and that BLOODY saxophone) yet not enough guitar.

No disrespect intended, but really the only bad things about Elvis were:
a) His strong self destructive bent, last years of his life; and
b) Fans who go ballistic if someone were to suggest that the pedestal we put him on was a bit too much.
Let's say, someone delivers a mean lick to Neil Young, Van Morrison, or Morrissey. People I happen to like a lot. How do I respond? I just smile, and say something like, 'not everyone's tastes are the same'. But IMO Mr. Presley was cursed by many of the fanbase who essentially lose their minds when Elvis is criticized. George Jones fans don't do this and Roy Orbison fans don't do this and Fats Domino fans don't do this and Waylon Jennings fans normally don't do this and even Johnny Cash fans almost never do this.
Why is an Elvis Presley fan entitled to special dispensation?

Btw, I'm posting this from Shelby County, Tennessee. Which still is where you go to find the King.
If some misguided person tried to move the Kingdom to Asbury Park, NJ (New Jersey?) I'd be happy to join you, to put a stop to that silliness.
I'll readily agree that the OP's videos are hard to defend and show some bad choices.
That said, given the hours this guy's been on stage, there's bound to be some stuff that wouldn't fly. If one adopts a wider view over the scope of his work, these two videos are in no way an accurate reflection of his work.
Whether one likes his bombast or not, I think it is more than hard to argue with the man's songwriting. Some excellent songs that can easily bear any interpretation.
More than once I've played/sung one of his songs and had a Bruce "hater" exclaim "WOW – who's song is that?!?!"
I love the Bruce.
I'm a little late to the party, getting in on page 6 of this thread, but I was at the concert where Jump was performed. I appreciated Bruce, but wanted to see what all the fuss was about. All the diehards said you gotta see him live. This was a free show so I figured why not.
It had been raining all day so the crowd was small and i ended up about 20 feet from the stage.
I'll say this, they opened with Jump and it was the weakest part of the show. They did a different cover every night of that tour and since the Final Four was going on in Dallas that weekend, they chose Jump.
Morello was incredible. Whoever was mixing knew exactly when to let him shine, and when to let him just fill the space in the background.
The concert was fantastic and I'm sold on his ability as a songwriter and a performer. I don't think he's the greatest thing ever, but he's up there.
I actually enjoyed him doing "Jump" a lot more than hearing him do his self-important Rich-Guy-Speaking-For-The-Common-Man songs. Just me...
When he REALLY lost me was that song, "Glory Days," when he sings about a baseball player who could "throw that SPEEDBALL" by you." It's called a "FASTBALL," Brucie...eeeccchhh!!!

Oh man!
THE ONLY album I ever bought and snapped in half and threw away was Born To Run and have not been able to stomach him ever since.
Dude is awkward to watch and his singing is bombastic. Lyrics incredibly over rated in an age of fantastic lyricists.
I guess it's an east coast thing.
Only thing worse is Elvis Costello showing up on EVERY tribute album for past 30 years with his cookie cutter delivery!

I can't respect Springsteen because of his phony "working man" shtick ,Click to expand...
So, you would rather Madonna's British Accent, I suppose?
He's an Entertainer, more than anything else. This, apparently, is the "schtick" that his fans like. Meanwhile, Bono gets slammed for distancing himself too far from his roots as an Irish kid from an ordinary background. From what I am told, a lot of the people who fight their way into these Springsteen concerts have humble beginnings. It has to rank as the least offensive think Bruce does. Now, if he was a Trust Fund Baby and went to finishing school, that would be different.
I think you've hit on the head, why Kris Kristofferson seemed so weird and out of context to me, at shows when he was on tour. He was too smart and way too well schooled for the "schtick" he did. I think Bruce Springsteen is more authentic sounding, than so many other famous performers these days.

he didn't grow up rich... he achieved it through song and performance... if a guy whens the lottery who was living on skid row... does he lose his right to talk about where he came from? my grandfather called a cutter an 'inshoot' and actually used speedball as a term for the heater or feebee or gas or major cheese or.... as egregious as parts of glory days is... it is nothing compared to 'centerfield' which I successfully banned during my coaching years... he is an old man now... imagine if somebody gave us a mic and let us do whatever we wanted... we'd say all kinds of stuff...
What if there was a great portrait of artists and musicians... and there were some defining characteristics... and upon learning those... our faces were not in the picture... would we dismiss the people who were in the picture or would we reconsider those characteristics and maybe embrace them?

I wish you could walk around in the South, and see simple people with their Tom Petty and Lynyrd Skynyrd T shirts and jackets with lyrics lifted from context and they make the words mean what they want them to mean and they don't give a hoot for a literary analysis.
Like it or not, but Bruce's themes and lyrics have been shoplifted and they are being used by misguided people to do misguided things.
Does this mean, he's made a mistake? No. But, just assuming that the "Real Truth" about someone's intentions (and the impact they will have) should be found at the granular level, is just one way of looking at things. Not the only way. The mere fact that some TDPRI posters didn't "get" Bruce the way you did, just demonstrates the law of unintended consequences when it comes to writing songs and lyrics.
I learned this is hard way, with the first name of the first band I was ever in. I thought kids with long hair and weird clothes could have a band called "The Wright Wing" and people wouldn't assume we were authoritarians. I was wrong.
The "Jump" cover was just awful. I was too embarrassed for them to watch their jump ball at the beginning without cringing. Tom Morello is a great player, but I don't think he fits well with Springsteen's style. I watched a clip of Morello singing "Ghost of Tom Joad" with Springsteen, and it was just awful.
Did anyone notice how jacked that percussionist is?!?
I like Springsteen's stuff from the mid-80's purely for the nostalgia of it. I love Nebraska. Ghost of Tom Joad is also quite good. Greetings from Asbury Park was really good songwriting, but like a rookie trying to write his magnum opus as his primum opus. Like every line had to be a revelation. Great stuff on Born to Run. But the keyboard-oriented E-Street stuff is mostly just nostalgic for me. Like "Born in the USA" and "Glory Days."
The Eddie Vedder sighting on "Highway to Hell" is funny to me. In the early- to mid-90's, he's doing everything he can to be in the very center of grunge, emulating Neil Young's grunge phase at every turn. Now he's all cleaned up and playing tambourine on "Highway to Hell" with Bruce Springsteen.

So, the best and most successful musicians, who become rich and famous, should only sing songs about being rich and famous?!?! I can't think of anyone who really pulled that off worth a damn other than the Stones. And they did it by being ironic and hilarious about it and stoned as hell for most of it.
Look, Bruce, as many of the best rockers, came from VERY humble beginnings. He lived a lower blue collar middle class childhood with a father suffering from severe depression and he was fighting the same thing. Music was the only thing that let him consistently get above the depression. Those early records, probably into much of Born to Run, WERE about his life and characters he knew and could relate to. And he was determined and incredibly good at it and then he was rich and famous. He had money, got treated for his depression (and helped his old man do the same), gained perspective. Went through a protracted lawsuit to get control of his music and career - gained MORE perspective and got richer.
And then, out of necessity, because he gave a damn about these people even if he couldn't really relate to them on a personal level anymore, he developed a songwriting persona of a guy he never was, but wasn't that far from the guy he grew up being. It was more Midwest factory worker instead of swamps of Jersey truck driver, but it was more or less the same guy. And like a great novelist who, lets face it, sits in front of a typewriter/word processor all day, he wrote about these people from a perspective that cared about them but wasn't of them anymore. It's what HAPPENS when people succeed. And to his credit, he did it really freaking well.
He never fought in Viet Nam, but he was of that generation and knew people who did, and Born in the USA was a pretty good depiction of how it ripped people apart and then abandoned them under the banner of patriotism. Anyone who thought that was nationalism just wan't paying attention. Reagan tried to use that song, obviously just hearing the chorus and missing the rest, and Bruce wouldn't let him. He never worked in a factory or went racing in the street, but wrote pretty damn good songs about those experiences. And to his credit, he walked the walk. During that '84 tour, when he was at his commercial peak, he spent damn near as much time on-stage raising money for veterans organizations and homeless shelters as he did singing. Not really, but he made a strong pitch for some really good organizations to help exactly the people he was singing about but obviously wasn't anymore.
So, how does he win you over? Sing about being rich and famous? Just live a crap life and end up in prison so he can sing about prison with more authority. Pull a Bucowsky and live among drunks and addicts so he can write about them more authentically but kill himself in the process? Hell, man, if I'd had his talent I can only HOPE I'd have handled it as well, put it so such good use, and continued to be able to do it at such a high level or half as long.

Except for small children, people ALWAYS have a choice in who they love and tolerate. Your good must outweigh your bad, as I think is the case with the vast majority of people, if those in your life continue to love and tolerate you. For sure, it takes less commitment to choose to like or reject an entertainer, but it's still about balancing the good against the bad.

I'm very happy that his music swept you away. It never did that for me. Structurally, all the elements are there, but I don't get that supernatural lift I can see happening to others.Click to expand...
This is my take on BS as well. I've always thought his music was.......fine. Not terrible, but certainly not world changing. I have never quite been able to understand his seemingly stratospheric popularity however.
I may as well chuck my couple pennies in...
I read his autobiography. It wasn't too bad. And in it, he admits it's harder to pull off the sort of lower middle class stuff these days. He seems to get that you don't feel the same when you're rich (and old). And he takes all the blame for his first marriage.
He's written a lot of songs. Most of them I don't much care for. But he's written a few great ones. I think I probably like the ones he wrote that were done by others more than the ones he did himself.
As for Born in the U.S.A., geez... Nationalistic? Listen to the lyrics. There's great hilarity in comparing it to This Land Is Your Land.
Some folks just don’t like his politics. As a performer and a songwriter he’s earned his acclaim.
I never thought much of him as a guitarist but then his performance with Roy Orbison and a few other videos made we reconsider. He’s better than some give him credit. He’s not my cup of tee but I recognize his talent. He does his thing.
He’s not a virtuoso.
I never hated or loved his stuff until I heard devils and dust, which I think is great. Now, I hear it all different, and I like pretty much all of it.

Compare this to the typical, vocal Ramones fan. They really (think they) did Invent the World and they're gonna remind you of it, every single chance they get. There's a certain innocent Harmlessness about Bruce Springsteen fans. They might totally ignore a great local band that's just a few miles from where they live, to the point that this promising and unique new band can't pay the bills and must disband, but the General Public has been doing that sort of thing for generations.

I just wanna say, I disagree with this sentiment, more than I disagree with anything in this thread or anything anyone has posted this week.
We as human beings, haven't got that much to say about who we love and who we can tolerate or not tolerate. That's the whole thing here. People here, I think, understand intellectually that the difference between artists we love and those we don't love can simply be "an affair of the heart". I know people who would desperately love to love Dylan, but they as individuals just spontaneously get ill when they hear his voice - and it can drive a wedge between them and their friends, and their girlfriend leaves and the teacher gives them a C- instead of an A. I consider it an excellent Blessing that no matter how Dylan sings, I just like it. Thank Goodness for it.
I don't want to listen to Jerry Garcia and "hear" so many notes sounding Sharp to me. I want the man to sound in tune to me because he was an amazing force - but it sounds Sharp, just often enough and all the human willpower is not going to change that. I hate that it ruins it for me, for serious listening purposes. Meanwhile, Bill Withers sings pitchy and I just don't let it bother me.
Everybody (not just musicians or music freaks) have some artist, that they know is intrinsically to be a professional and gifted artist, but the listener has nonetheless got a migraine or his teeth are grinding. You can NOT control what you love and don't love.

Well written, my good man. I like the cut of your jib. Even if you do wear that silly Eagles hat.
Interesting how people see things..
A coupe of thoughts..
For those who don't beleive Bruce and the band work for a living, try preparing, playing a three hour show, and then touring it. Now he doesen't do the long hauls the way he did BITD, but it's still a pretty intense experience, I spent part the summer of 2016 in rehearsal for a six gig stadium tour of the mid west, 12 hour days, for a month.. it's work at any age, at 54. I was really feeling it. IIRC Max Weinberg is pretty much worn out physically with serious joint problems not far different from doing 30 years "down the mill" like my GF did, (took his knees out), Playing once a week down at the Twist and Shout is a walk in the park in comparison.
Thru my work, I know a lot of people who have a lot of talent; many have money some have come from humble backgrounds of many types, some work hard, some are very smart, some fell into it, some ..well I don't know where IT came from but they have something going on.
Don't really care, what I do care about is the big picture, I have never worked w/ Bruce but i have worked with people like him, I rarely criticize those who thru their efforts have created something for themselves and in the process helped others to do the same. I find that those who have done that are proud to stand on their accomplishments, and let others stand on theirs, often assisting as they can, rarely do you hear a harsh word about another or their work.
Yes they may set you teeth on edge, but as a mentor once told me "we are all in this together, and that is our strength: when you criticize one of us, you criticize all of us.."
Those who feel they haven't maximized their potential for what ever reason, can be petty and vindictive, sniping and critical. One of my favorite colleagues has a saying. "The only thing you control is YOU..make the most of it"

I guess. I still cant understand their complete fascination but thats how it goes.
My wife HATES the cowpunk band X. She cant stand to hear Xcene. I've always loved X, Billy Zoom was an email pen pal of mine for a long time.
I will often tell my wife, yeah, Excene cant sing. I know it. I dont care. I'm aware they are hideously flawed. So am I and you still like me, so.... ????
But music brings out a visceral reaction in people and a lot of times, people react strongly when you criticize their fave or present something the artist did in a negative light. Springsteen fans can be at the extreme edge of this.
I mean, you could put up a video of X from the latest tour and say, "This sucks, Billy cant even stand up anymore, this sounds like crap and Excene is worse than ever" and I dont think I would protest. I might listen and think, yeah, that DID suck. Oh well.
People are all different.

I didn't really mean it the way you took it, but that's on me for not communicating worth a damn. I was mostly responding to another poster talking about people in his life not having a choice, comparing it to the choice you have with a distant musician. For sure, it would be almost impossible, but not quite in the worst cases, for a parent NOT to love a child, no matter how terrible that child turned out to be. And you can't choose to love something you don't love. I guess I was attempting to talk about the "tolerate" part more than the "love" part. Love is to some extent an involuntary response. What to tolerate is a choice. Parents who love their children still make very difficult decisions not to tolerate them if they become, well, intolerable as adults, sometimes even as teenagers. I've seen it with some, fortunately not all that close, family members. But for sure the choice of whether to tolerate someone is affected by whether you love them or not. And that's never gonna run as deep with a distant musician as a close family member or friend. If you love someone, it will take a LOT more before you'd be unwilling to tolerate them.
I guess the point I was TRYING to make is that in making the choice whether to tolerate someone - and I do think that "tolerate" part is a choice - would pretty much always involve an understanding of both the good and the bad of that person, whether a friend or relative or a distant musician who's either touched you with his or her music, or not. Which was a VERY long way of saying, "don't judge Bruce by that one or two videos of his worst moments". Which the fellow I was responding to might or might not have been doing in the first place...
-Ray
what, procedurally, actually happens when one does not tolerate an artist? if we use a definition of the purpose of art as a creation that elicits an emotional response or intellectual conversation.... wouldn't not tolerating an artist and their art actually be a way of appreciating it?

I kinda admire your innocent way of looking at parents and their kids.
From behind the lawyer's desk, and in the courtroom, I have just seen too many undeniable examples of parents who hated their kids or the kids hated a parent or two. Yes, we do have to deal with some of the less good apples, sometimes. I've had clients, witnesses look at me and insist they loved their parent or child, but their actions is how we know it wasn't so. And (and this is the kicker) the person who was hated wasn't a whole lot different than the person who hated them, and often enough they were the "better" or less screwed up member of the now broken family. It is IMO a wicked thing, but a true thing, that just because you're related to someone, you can't always expect love from them. I mean, look at how brutal Bruce's father was toward him - he spent a lot of time "out of the house" as a youngster and Bruce will remind you of it without much encouragement.

I kinda admire your innocent way of looking at parents and their kids.
From behind the lawyer's desk, and in the courtroom, I have just seen too many undeniable examples of parents who hated their kids or the kids hated a parent or two. Yes, we do have to deal with some of the less good apples, sometimes. I've had clients, witnesses look at me and insist they loved their parent or child, but their actions is how we know it wasn't so. And (and this is the kicker) the person who was hated wasn't a whole lot different than the person who hated them, and often enough they were the "better" or less screwed up member of the now broken family. It is IMO a wicked thing, but a true thing, that just because you're related to someone, you can't always expect love from them. I mean, look at how brutal Bruce's father was toward him - he spent a lot of time "out of the house" as a youngster and Bruce will remind you of it without much encouragement.Click to expand...
I guess I can't imagine a parent not loving their kid. I can imagine, and have seen enough situations where the parent couldn't tolerate a kid or decided it was not in either of their best interests to continue to tolerate them. But I can't imagine that being anything other than a heart-wrenchingly difficult conclusion to come to.
My wife has a couple of brothers like that. I know her mother can't tolerate them any longer and basically doesn't, but I know that as much pain as they've caused her, she still loves them and their condition still tears her up inside. One of them produced a child who my wife and I played a very large part in raising and we reached that point with him too. He's terribly mentally ill and in prison somewhere in Colorado now and I know we can't do a damn thing for him, but it still hurts like hell to think of him in that state. Still love him, but can't tolerate him and it wouldn't do him any good if we could.
And from what I've read, as difficult as Bruce's childhood was, and as much time as he spent avoiding his old man - I can't play "Independence Day" without fighting back tears - they reconciled and he got his Dad a lot of help and it sounds like they had a relationship again before he died. I don't think that's a lack of love, but there were times they couldn't tolerate each other. I'm sure you're right, though, that there are situation where even the love dies even among the closest relatives, and I am too innocent to be able to understand that on anything other than an intellectual level. And I'm damn thankful I am...

Bruce has always sounded constipated. I saw him on The River tour, and I get why people like him. He puts on an epic live show. Too bad I can't stand his music.

My wife HATES the cowpunk band X. She cant stand to hear Xcene. I've always loved X, Billy Zoom was an email pen pal of mine for a long time.
I will often tell my wife, yeah, Excene cant sing. I know it. I dont care. I'm aware they are hideously flawed. So am I and you still like me, so.... ????Click to expand...
Wow, I love X but they are the only band that anyone might consider punk that I even listen to. Exene can't sing? I just got their "Live in Latin America" CD and for all I can tell they sound almost exactly the way they did 30 years ago. On the flip side, almost all their songs sound quite similar so a little goes a long ways.
Yes Exene doesn't sing like anyone else. X without the singing? Can't imagine it.

Xcene has never been a great or "traditional" singer. I always thought the harmony between her and John was good, almost spooky weird at times. But on her own? You dont have to go far in the X catalog to find an example of something a BUNCH of people could hear and think, yuck, that woman cant sing.
Her lyrics are amazing to me tho. "the devil drives a Buick and he sits and inside and eats lunch. Then he sticks his pitchfork thru the trunk and into the spare, and pulls out true love, true love, its the devils crowbar." I dont even know what that means and I think its great.
I met her once, at about 2 in the afternoon before a show. She was already drunk. I guess she worked hard at that for awhile.
I dont wanna derail this thread about X tho, its about Springsteen. I've never met an X fan that acted like a Springsteen fanboi. I'm not saying there arent people like that, there probably are. BUT music forums arent exactly filled up with them either.

he didn't grow up rich... he achieved it through song and performance... if a guy whens the lottery who was living on skid row... does he lose his right to talk about where he came from? my grandfather called a cutter an 'inshoot' and actually used speedball as a term for the heater or feebee or gas or major cheese or.... as egregious as parts of glory days is... it is nothing compared to 'centerfield' which I successfully banned during my coaching years... he is an old man now... imagine if somebody gave us a mic and let us do whatever we wanted... we'd say all kinds of stuff...

So, you would rather Madonna's British Accent, I suppose?
He's an Entertainer, more than anything else. This, apparently, is the "schtick" that his fans like. Meanwhile, Bono gets slammed for distancing himself too far from his roots as an Irish kid from an ordinary background. From what I am told, a lot of the people who fight their way into these Springsteen concerts have humble beginnings. It has to rank as the least offensive think Bruce does. Now, if he was a Trust Fund Baby and went to finishing school, that would be different.
I think you've hit on the head, why Kris Kristofferson seemed so weird and out of context to me, at shows when he was on tour. He was too smart and way too well schooled for the "schtick" he did. I think Bruce Springsteen is more authentic sounding, than so many other famous performers these days.Click to expand...
Oh, I don't hate the guy. And he IS a great entertainer.

So, the best and most successful musicians, who become rich and famous, should only sing songs about being rich and famous?!?! I can't think of anyone who really pulled that off worth a damn other than the Stones. And they did it by being ironic and hilarious about it and stoned as hell for most of it.
Look, Bruce, as many of the best rockers, came from VERY humble beginnings. He lived a lower blue collar middle class childhood with a father suffering from severe depression and he was fighting the same thing. Music was the only thing that let him consistently get above the depression. Those early records, probably into much of Born to Run, WERE about his life and characters he knew and could relate to. And he was determined and incredibly good at it and then he was rich and famous. He had money, got treated for his depression (and helped his old man do the same), gained perspective. Went through a protracted lawsuit to get control of his music and career - gained MORE perspective and got richer.
And then, out of necessity, because he gave a damn about these people even if he couldn't really relate to them on a personal level anymore, he developed a songwriting persona of a guy he never was, but wasn't that far from the guy he grew up being. It was more Midwest factory worker instead of swamps of Jersey truck driver, but it was more or less the same guy. And like a great novelist who, lets face it, sits in front of a typewriter/word processor all day, he wrote about these people from a perspective that cared about them but wasn't of them anymore. It's what HAPPENS when people succeed. And to his credit, he did it really freaking well.
He never fought in Viet Nam, but he was of that generation and knew people who did, and Born in the USA was a pretty good depiction of how it ripped people apart and then abandoned them under the banner of patriotism. Anyone who thought that was nationalism just wan't paying attention. Reagan tried to use that song, obviously just hearing the chorus and missing the rest, and Bruce wouldn't let him. He never worked in a factory or went racing in the street, but wrote pretty damn good songs about those experiences. And to his credit, he walked the walk. During that '84 tour, when he was at his commercial peak, he spent damn near as much time on-stage raising money for veterans organizations and homeless shelters as he did singing. Not really, but he made a strong pitch for some really good organizations to help exactly the people he was singing about but obviously wasn't anymore.
So, how does he win you over? Sing about being rich and famous? Just live a crap life and end up in prison so he can sing about prison with more authority. Pull a Bucowsky and live among drunks and addicts so he can write about them more authentically but kill himself in the process? Hell, man, if I'd had his talent I can only HOPE I'd have handled it as well, put it so such good use, and continued to be able to do it at such a high level or half as long.

Oh, I don't hate Bruce. And he IS a great entertainer.
I sometimes wonder too. My brother loves him. Edited to say I do appreciate what he's accomplished. I just don't like it much.
The thing that puzzles me on some of these threads is the amount of energy some people put into disliking a particular artist. In second place is my amazement at the energy expended to defend one's love for the artist.
It's almost unsettling. I've expressed my feelings that I can appreciate the genius of Pink Floyd but in no way care to listen to their music. I would expect that to be the end of that thought stream but it seldom is. Someone will inevitably try to convince me that I should enjoy their music.

Some folks just don’t like his politics. As a performer and a songwriter he’s earned his acclaim.
I never thought much of him as a guitarist but then his performance with Roy Orbison and a few other videos made we reconsider. He’s better than some give him credit. He’s not my cup of tee but I recognize his talent. He does his thing.
He’s not a virtuoso.Click to expand...
No, and James Burton made that very clear in the Roy Orbison performance!!
I fell out of love.
I was big into his first few albums ("Darkness," "The Wild, The Innocent," "Born to Run," and "Greetings"). I thought that "The River" could have been a single album. I never understood (but was happy) that so many critics dug "Nebraska." I was underwhelmed by "Born in the USA" and lost interest after "Tunnel of Love" (which has a great side 2).
But I'm still moved by his 9/11 performance of "My City of Ruins."
I think I like his Secret garden song the best, followed by the Streets of Philadelphia and a raw Nebraska version of the Born in the USA. A few others here and there and that's about it. The most iritating is the way they (E-street) employ sax in their music. Only The Blues Brothers do it more unbearable.

His early stuff was entertaining . Sometime past , I recall an interview with Bruce where he declared how great he is and espoused his superior intellect . Claimed that he was the smartest person in his school including the teachers , et al .Click to expand...
I get where he is coming from on that. If you read his bio you'll find his early life was anything but conventional or disciplined. Not that he was visionary, just on a way different plane. To go from his early life into a world of daily routine and provincial attitudes proscribed by others when one's mind is anyplace else but that must have been extremely frustrating, and could easily lead to that kind of grandiose attitude.

Guitar forums tend to prioritize different things than others.
When it comes to capturing time and place, Springsteen had it all figured out. I thought he'd lost it - but seeing him in NJ in 2002 do the Rising tour proved me wrong. His songs are just a feeling. It works.
If you pick his stuff apart with tweezers, it doesn't make sense.

He didn’t dodge it though, he was rejected on medical grounds. Which has a tinge about it today of course. But he wasn’t from the families who could pay for that.
And bitusa is in support of veterans and their treatment. Not in favour of signing up and going. The ones I can’t stand are those who say I’m a pacifist till the reach the age where they can’t be drafted and suddenly it’s ,kill them all let god sort it out'.
That to me is a bit hypocritical. (And that’s not a slight at you, btw. I’m just building on what we’re talking about).
I don’t like wives in bands either (wings and abba and Fleetwood mac are exceptions and possibly e street.)

Now, just a minute.
"Alice's Restaurant" didn't work, a lot of the time, and this "LSD" thing usually didn't work. He got out of there by sheer luck. Quotas had already been met and etc. Unlike some well off folks who chose means that were more or less a lock tight cinch.
Fine, for a contrite person to say he "dodged the draft" by offering a stupid excuse, that shouldn't have worked but somehow did, but more likely he was gonna be called upon to serve, and see combat like those guys in that kind of neighborhood often did. While the affluent kids from my street slipped by.
I suppose next, somebody is gonna tell me I dodged the draft by coming out of the womb a year too late, or something.

Well... I can say for certain that was a true butchering of that song!
Never been a big Bruce Springsteen fan... I rope him together with John Cougar Mellonhead.
Both of them serving pop tunes for middle aged factory workers from the time they started til now.
It's like Wooderson said "I get older but (the audience) they stay the same age"
It's lame and non interesting to me.
Everytime a Mellonhead song comes on the radio I have to turn it off...before the "little diddy" even starts.
Same with Springsteen.

Born In The USA was released when I was in high school. I wasn't a huge fan, but you simply couldn't avoid hearing those songs back then. As a result, hearing them now still takes me back to that point in my life (as does other popular music from that era), which is a pretty cool thing.

Nebraska was a stroke of genius.
Bruce is also quite the bandmaster.

When I come home the house is dark
She sighs, "Baby did you make it all right,"
She sits on the porch of her Daddy's house
But all her pretty dreams are torn,
She stares off alone into the night
With the eyes of one who hates for just being born
For all the shut down strangers and hot rod angels,
Rumbling through this promised land
Tonight my baby and me, we're gonna ride to the sea
And wash these sins off our hands.

It's a little unfair to compare almost anyone to James Burton in that style of music. I actually thought Bruce played his lead parts pretty well in that show. My beef is that he made himself too present with his singing and constantly moving into Roy's space.
I don't really think Bruce has really ever tried to present himself as a guitar hero. Like I said, I'm not really into him and have only one of his songs in my iTunes library.
One thing I'll say is that I think he is authentic in his music. I can't say that about a lot of the people who get constant hype as guitar heroes.

I think a lot of who we consider "good" or "over-rated", "under-rated", etc just comes to what we fundamentally like. And what we like is affected by SOOOO many factors beyond whether someone is actually talented or realizes their talent or whatever. There are a lot of country players who are, objectively, fantastic / amazing / unbelievable. But with rare exceptions, I'm not much of a country music fan, so a lot of them are simply lost on me. Same with a lot of metal players who can blow the doors off of any building, but I'd be one of the first ones OUT of that building. OTOH, someone I just fundamentally LIKE, like Neil Young or Tom Verlaine, who may or may not be the greatest guitarists in the world by whatever objective standards there are for such things, sound like they're really good to me because I like what they create, regardless of degree of difficulty. Their music speaks to me and that's all music is ultimately about - technical proficiency can surely help you make great music, but I'd rather listen to a really limited player who's music reaches me than the most amazing player in the world if I can't relate to what they're doing.
I like Springsteen. I never really thought that hard about whether he was a great guitarist or not - a lot of his guitar playing moved me in the context of his songs. Some of the jazzy chord dancing in Kitty's back, some of the aggressive mean sounding playing in Candy's Room, etc - that stuff communicates what he wanted to communicate and it got straight to me on a level that matters. It's not really about "good" - it's about making it work in the service of the song. Which is the least objective thing you can measure. If it works for you, it's great, to you. If it doesn't, it's not. So about all any of us can say is what we like.
I know the guys in Rush can all play, I know Al DeMeola can play, I know Roy Buchanan can play - but their music doesn't do a damn thing for me so to me they're only "good" in some theoretical, technical sense that doesn't matter. It's trite to say, but I'd rather hear BB King play one note that will rip my heart out than DeMeola play 10000 notes in the same time that leave me scratching my head...

The ONLY thing Bruce Springsteen and Danny Gatton have in common is they play a similar instrument. How you can even think to compare them is way beyond my intellectual capability. It's like saying Buddy Holly is worthless because he didn't play his strat the same way Hendrix played his strat. Some things are just too totally different to have any reason to compare them... You could compare me to Clapton - he's great and I suck but we both play strats and I'm sort of trying to do some of the same stuff, so it's a valid comparison on some level. But you can't compare me to Pavrotti for crying out loud!

I have a buddy, and his kid is a bad drug addict and it doing a long stint in jail.
My buddy insists he was a lousy father. He's "admitted" it, and so by your metrics his kid is in jail on account of him.
But that's false. My friend did everything and more, that a father can do. The kid just didn't take, and he wasn't gonna be a good kid no matter who parented him.
This is the same thing. I don't mind people confessing to things they didn't really do. What I do mind is people who can't recognize it when it is right there.

Do you not believe Springsteen was being honest when he said that he dodged the draft ?

I think a lot of who we consider "good" or "over-rated", "under-rated", etc just comes to what we fundamentally like. And what we like is affected by SOOOO many factors beyond whether someone is actually talented or realizes their talent or whatever. There are a lot of country players who are, objectively, fantastic / amazing / unbelievable. But with rare exceptions, I'm not much of a country music fan, so a lot of them are simply lost on me. Same with a lot of metal players who can blow the doors off of any building, but I'd be one of the first ones OUT of that building. OTOH, someone I just fundamentally LIKE, like Neil Young or Tom Verlaine, who may or may not be the greatest guitarists in the world by whatever objective standards there are for such things, sound like they're really good to me because I like what they create, regardless of degree of difficulty. Their music speaks to me and that's all music is ultimately about - technical proficiency can surely help you make great music, but I'd rather listen to a really limited player who's music reaches me than the most amazing player in the world if I can't relate to what they're doing.
I like Springsteen. I never really thought that hard about whether he was a great guitarist or not - a lot of his guitar playing moved me in the context of his songs. Some of the jazzy chord dancing in Kitty's back, some of the aggressive mean sounding playing in Candy's Room, etc - that stuff communicates what he wanted to communicate and it got straight to me on a level that matters. It's not really about "good" - it's about making it work in the service of the song. Which is the least objective thing you can measure. If it works for you, it's great, to you. If it doesn't, it's not. So about all any of us can say is what we like.
I know the guys in Rush can all play, I know Al DeMeola can play, I know Roy Buchanan can play - but their music doesn't do a damn thing for me so to me they're only "good" in some theoretical, technical sense that doesn't matter. It's trite to say, but I'd rather hear BB King play one note that will rip my heart out than DeMeola play 10000 notes in the same time that leave me scratching my head...
The ONLY thing Bruce Springsteen and Danny Gatton have in common is they play a similar instrument. How you can even think to compare them is way beyond my intellectual capability. It's like saying Buddy Holly is worthless because he didn't play his strat the same way Hendrix played his strat. Some things are just too totally different to have any reason to compare them... You could compare me to Clapton - he's great and I suck but we both play strats and I'm sort of trying to do some of the same stuff, so it's a valid comparison on some level. But you can't compare me to Pavrotti for crying out loud!

My point about Danny Gatton is that Bruce Springsteen is often referred to as a Tele hero...
I say Danny Gatton is more of a hero of the telecaster than him.
That's all I'm saying... of course I would never compare the two, because there is no comparison.

How many albums did Bruce Springsteen sell?
He has sold 64.5 million albums in the US making him the 15th highest-selling artist of all-time and seventh highest-selling male artist
Not too shabby. Anyone on this thread sold more music than that?
Not unless your name is
Garth Brooks (135 million)
Elvis Presley (134.5 million)
Billy Joel (81.5 million)
Michael Jackson (81 million)
Elton John (73.5 million) or
George Strait (69 million)

Fair enough. As long as we can agree that people have always had disagreements but that the internet has fostered a whole new method for anonymous voices to reinforce the "us and them" mentality that's growing minute by minute.
And no, I'm not immune, but I can at least see what's in front of my eyes and am trying to understand my own reactions as well as those of others. I used to look at the internet as a positive advancement of technology...I'm rethinking that.

I think this thread should win some sort of award for the repeated use of the word bombast.
I get that there is a messianic streak in regards to Bruce and his fans. There seems to be an anti-messianic streak to his detractors.
In the end maybe he wasn't the sum total of the future of rock and roll but he sure did seem like it at the time. I like Bruce those concerts I saw in the early to late 70's were amazing. If you don't like Bruce that's okay, he'd probably still like you.

Some folks just don’t like his politics. As a performer and a songwriter he’s earned his acclaim.
I never thought much of him as a guitarist but then his performance with Roy Orbison and a few other videos made we reconsider. He’s better than some give him credit. He’s not my cup of tee but I recognize his talent. He does his thing.
He’s not a virtuoso.Click to expand...
That's one thing that gets to me, people paid good money to come to the show to be entertained. If they wanted to hear about politics, they could've saved their money and watched TV News, TV Shows or listened to Talk Radio.
I think his strength is putting on a good show and I can be entertained by him and his music, but if he's going to start ranting about politics, I'm going to leave and want my money back.

So an artist can sing politically resonant songs but can't talk about it? That's an odd construct.
On the contrary, I think artists have an OBLIGATION to speak to their society. I can't imagine going to a Springsteen, Steve Earle, or Mellencamp concert and NOT expecting to hear some political talk.

Not all the songs are about politics and listening to song with some political meaning every now and then is fine, even if you disagree with the position.
Add political rants between the songs and it gets to be too much even for those that lean that way. It becomes a buzzkill.

Funny you say that.....I was in an original music band at the time.
I recall the Time mag cover you mention and thinking...."Bruce who?....never heard of him".
Knowing music preference is quite subjective I never found his (sometimes) verbose lyrical story telling or music overall very appealing and bordering on vapid.
That is not to diminish his level of musicianship or band success at all....just my irrelevant opinion.
I've read more than once that his live shows are very entertaining.
Ultimately, one person's musical preference can be another person's definition of noise.
There are a few good songs I found OK but that's about it.
But...he and the E Street band have had great success and will be happy to race me to the bank.

actors and songwriters are both artists. some artists are not songwriters. some singers do not play instruments. all actors are entertainers as well as being artists. some rock entertainers are also musicians, song writers and artists. Some songwriters keep the scope of their work to love and general topics, some songwriters write songs that have social and political commentary.
When you go to a concert if the entertainer is, say, Sinatra... you could say 'shut up and sing' because that is what they do.. they sing. Sing the hits dang it! and that would be fair. But, I saw Sinatra and even he didn't do that. He talked about all kinds of things.
An artist like Springsteen is: entertainer, musician, singer, chief songwriter. When you buy their music you buy the whole package even if you only like parts of what they do... so, if you go to their concert, you cannot expect them to simply shut up and sing or play... it is not who they represented themselves to be and as much of the audience that came to hear 'prove it all night' want to hear what the boss thinks about xyz policy. If you went to a Stephen Bishop concert... he sings, plays, writes.... but his songs are about love and loss... he isn't gonna say squat about elections etc.
What folks have to do is accept artists OR NOT for who they are and what they do. If you like jackson browne's 'Stay' you should also know that MANY of his songs are about things that are controversial that may conflict with what you've been told to believe by others.
When people storm out of a concert because of opinions that upset their little hearts... you have to shake your head and say, "did you not understand an artist that you paid money for their music? do you not know the lyrics? do you not know what is going on? We have discovered that those things ARE true for a lot of people... the old dick clark american bandstand thing where they rated songs and we joked about the dumb kids who would 'has a good beat, easy to dance to' turns out to be a lot more representative of music purchasers than we'd like to admit. Unfortunately, this phenomenon is merely a symptom.
I like a lot of his material spanning different eras: The Ties That Bind, Cadillac Ranch, Thunder Road, Two Hearts, Leap of Faith, Johnny 99... If nothing else, his ability to remain a relevant artist for decades really stands out. But there's plenty of his work that does nothing for me at all. Putting it all together, in the big scheme that is the rock and roll universe his contribution to rock music is to be respected.
Not my favorite artist, but certainly one who I tip my hat to.

I've gone to many concerts in my life and didn't have to listen to someone rant about politics and other subjects.
If an artist wants to give us his/her opinions on politics, that's fine. They reserve the right to do it, and I reserve the right to be turned off by it (no snarkiness intended).
I'm just amazed sometimes that these people think we WANT to hear their political views. For real, if it wasn't for the politics-free music, we would not even know their names. But for some reason once they become popular and bank a bunch of money, they seem to forget the reason we even liked them in the first place.
To put it into perspective, replace "politics" with "sports." If I went to a Springsteen concert and in between every song the guy is lecturing the audience on the problems with the NCAA Football playoff system, we would all be looking at each other thinking, "what?!" Your music made you famous and able to sell $100+ tickets. That doesn't make you an expert on anything else.
We would feel the same way if the President used his State of the Union address to talk to us about his fantasy football team. Stick to what you know. I guess the problem is what so many famous people think they know.
But to the OP, I don't get Springsteen either. I can't disparage his accomplishments, the guy has sold out way more arenas than I have.

there is a point where a person has to just understand that either purposefully or naturally, some folks are not going to understand. One of my sisters when we were teenagers would debate stuff with members of my family and her friends... and.. at some point... she would just say, "I'm just right about this no matter what you say."
and most of us (especially those who love her) would choose that moment to disengage wordlessly. It only makes sense.

What's a guy in that sort of situation supposed to say?
He's boxed in. He knows the people that don't admire him will taunt him for not admitting he tried to play the system, so he's obliged to admit to something. And Bruce Springsteen already knows that a guy like me will fully appreciate his predicament and won't hold it against him, that he confessed to bumbling that no-body sees as being egregious or associated with low character.
Doesn't what happened to my friend and his jailed son resonate with you at all? We're men - we're supposed to accept responsibility when in doubt. And everyone else is supposed to actually look at the facts and decide how they feel about what happened. I'm truly sorry you're so poisoned to the guy. And I'm defending this man even though normally, I'd prefer to be entertained by someone other than Bruce Springsteen.

I don't accept that. I think the guy's status is based on maybe a dozen of his hits, that got the most attention. This one song, would never have done much, alone by itself.
There's absolutely a strong Tribal aspect to the fan appeal of Springsteen, but the politics of this tribe are frankly, all over the place. And. I don't think there's all that clear of an understanding as to what the song is actually saying. I think a lot of people assign the meaning to the song that suits their expectations and needs.
The fact that the song was preceded by and was followed by other songs with dense themes, about freedom and trying to come up from the working class, and trying to find meaning in life, would Nuance this big "Born in the USA" song even if it had some blatant message that could penetrate even the most obtuse brain.
Trying to Pigeonhole people in this fashion is probably not the best course of action - we're complex, and we're evolving. I'm still trying to figure out who this guy is - I like it that way.
You guys are just too old. I remember being so in love with a girl called many bolton when I was 17 that it hurt. The soundtrack to that yearning was 'she's the one' with its killer piano intro. The life I planned for us was straight out of 'no surrender'. It never came to anything obviously but No-one nails it for us dreamers like bruce.

Uh-oh.
Some musicians communicate through music. They can be awful, trying to express thoughts in interviews and speeches and this sort of thing. Look at Van Morrison: He usually seems like he's off his meds, trying to give an interview. The music is probably the medium that most musical performers should work with. IF they also have a knack for persuasion as to values or issues, in a spoken or perhaps a written form, that's great but personally I am never going to make it an
Obligation
that someone divert resources to attempting this if they're unable to do this job of speaking. If you're good at it and you see an opportunity to change hearts and minds, fine. If you expect you'll create only trouble, save your powder. Put it in the form of a song, or concert proceeds for a cause. Don't expect disapproval from me if preaching cannot work for you.

I suspect you would be correct, in Desoto or Tate County. And also Sedgwick County, Co and Kern County, CA. There is a sort of dissociative fugue thing going on in some parts of the country, where the singer's music comes in on the same wavelength as the listener, but in terms of positions on various issues, the Artist and Fan are not aligned at all.
I do appreciate that we could have more peace and order if we just did the music. But. You have to feed the Spirit of someone like Neil Young or Bruce Springsteen - or even Robert Plant. If an audience is hostile and immovable as to the basic values and mores of the artist, you are drinking his well dry and may not even know it. Somebody has to replentish it and the way that can get done, IMO is if the Artist and the Audience (or many of them) have a shared or communal moment of common faith, values and beliefs. Those audiences rejuvenate the Artist - we keep his spiritual tank filled, not just his pocketbook filled.
I go and see performers whose fan base is way off in another world from me, in terms of their attitudes and beliefs and I appreciate that the Performer had better agree with them whether he does in private, or not. I kinda have to look the other way as he or she caters to the philosophical leanings of the bulk of the crowd, the same way I lean the other way when a number of the attendees to one side of me haven't bathed lately, or are perilously close to passing out from booze or other substances. It doesn't do any good to complain, and if we stop buying tickets, then the music just stops altogether.

Well first of all my point was in reply to the idea that Bruce became famous before becoming political. While he was a popular artist before Born in The USA he wasn't the superstar who could sell out 7 nights in a row at a stadium and he wasn't a worldwide star. There is no separating 1984/85 Springsteen from his politics at the time. It infused the record and the world tour.
Beyond that at this late date he's a more nuanced artist with a much broader song catalog.
Far more interesting to me than his politics was his decision to turn away from his superstar status and release Tunnel of Love instead of trying to repeat the success of Born in the USA.

He was pretty damn popular when he toured behind The River in 1980. I saw the show he played in Tempe, AZ (where, for some reason - radio play I think - he was HUGE when he was only huge in Jersey and Virginia in the early 70s). They released a film of this show - it was the night after the 1980 election and he was VERY political from the stage that night, very somber as well. He wasn't as big then as he was in 1984, but he wasn't far from it. I saw him a few times in the '70s and never remember any politics at all, but when Reagan got elected, he talked about it. Talked about it before he played any music if I remember right, which I very well may not.
Actually, I saw him the night after the 1980 election and I most recently saw him play about three songs the night BEFORE the 2016 election at a huge rally in Philly where both Clintons and both Obamas showed up and spoke. Given the way those two elections turned out, I don't think I'm gonna go see Bruce right around any more elections! Although the other time I saw him perform in a political context was at a big Obama rally / voter registration drive in October 2008. I think I prefer to remember that one... I don't even remember Obama being at that rally, but he MUST have been given how many gazillion people showed up...

Disclaimer: I have not read most of what y'all have written! I do agree with what some have said about him being...well, bombastic. I chalk some of it up to the E street band and the Boss "putting on a good show for the people" in a blue collar sort of sense. Conversely, the albums Tom Joad and Devils and Dust are masterfully understated, IMHO--for those of you who feel like you're missing something about the Boss' appeal. Also, hard to knock him for pretending to be this way, or that way: he's an artist. It's his JOB to pretend! I'm not a super fan but really do wish I could've seen the Tom Joad tour that he did solo and acoustic.

On the live CD set he talks about it and suggests that. I haven’t heard it in years but now I think about it he just suggests rather than states. (And my memory ... let’s just not).
FWIW, I wouldn't fault anyone for getting hung up and completely thrown off the Boss, based solely on the incessant, cheesy keyboard throughout the song "Born in the USA." It would be a mistake--one I made a long time ago, but I've since made amends!

He was pretty damn popular when he toured behind The River in 1980.Click to expand...
I wouldn't say he was unknown by the river tour but his growth from darkness to Born was exponential. In Toronto for darkness he played half the gardens about 8000 ppl, for the river he played the full gardens so maybe 20,000 ppl. But for Born he played multiple dates first time half of the ex at about 35, 000 a night then on the second time around the full stadium so 60,000 a night. for a total north of 200,000 tickets.

I've made it through this whole thread and have still not listened to the vids...just for the reason that I've watched horrible vids of people I've REALLY liked and it jades me to the bad so much that's all I can hear when I think of them.
Not gonna do it. There's embarrassing vids of everybody out there if you look! I'd just as soon see the good ones...
I really haven't paid much attention to BS since the 70s, I was getting drawn in by "Greetings from Asbury Park", and "The Wild, The Innocent etc." but got totally turned off by the "Born to Run" hype scene. In some ways you have to respect BS for not imploding from that crap.
I found it interesting that Jackson Brown saw him a big rival back when, and I have to admit I like a lot more JB songs than BS songs.
Mostly I find people nowadays railing on BS for political reasons, something he shares in common with Steve Earle.
FWIW I don't think anyone can hold a candle to Steve Earle solo and acoustic, but BS has always been more photogenic.
What I'm more inclined to want to see are the clips that showcase the best of these big names. Here's an example of a Bruce moment with a crappy cell phone and terrible sound but he makes the crowd happy and puts an accompanying fan on the moon...I get goosebumps when stuff like this happens. It's magic...
I saw Bruuuuce twice (kinda being dragged along by a good friend who is still a good friend).
Here's what I remember.
At the Oakland Coliseum:
a) The band all donned gigantic cowboy hats and ran around on the stage while playing at one point. This was immensely entertaining (cough).
b) For the intro of "Born in the USA", Bruce turned around so that the video camera could zoom in on his jeans clad tushy (like the album cover, I get it) which he twitched rhythmically to the utter delight of all assembled.
At Shoreline:
a) Don't remember which song it was, but he had a bench on stage and he and Clayrence sat on it while Bruce "reminisced" about "how we used to sit around after work and watch gurlzzzzz" while Clayrence just smiled and smiled. Del Monte doesn't move that much corn in a year!
b) encore = 20 minute version of "Twist and Shout". I was twisting and shouting because I really needed to take a leak but didn't want to get separated from the group.

Ooops - massive edit. I thought "Born" meant Born to Run and wrote a whole post about the confusing timeline. Then I realized you meant Born in the USA and it makes a lot more sense. I saw him play sold out arenas in the 70's on Darkness and in 1980 on The River. These were in Arizona, though, where he was really big when he was only also really big in the Jersey / NYC / Philly area and Richmond, VA area. So I may have had an unrealistic feel for how popular he already was. In Arizona he was big before Born to Run, so by Darkness and the River there was no place in the state big enough to hold him. I KNOW that Born in the USA was his commercial peak everywhere. That was my least favorite album of his up to that point, but I saw the tour and he was in incredible form playing live then.
As you may tell I'm a huge Springsteen fan and don't get how anyone could say he's an overrated performer - clearly you haven't seen him perform yourself (youtube clips DO NOT count).
I get his music may not be to everyone's taste as its a very subjective thing, but I just had to challenge the performance aspect as he's been delivering powerful 3 to 4 hour shows night after night for decades.
I don't think he'd claim to be one of the best guitarists around and I don't think that's what people go to see him for, but I'd still call him a legend of the telecaster for his devotion to the instrument: http://documents.latimes.com/bruce-springsteen-stratocaster/

What's a guy in that sort of situation supposed to say?
He's boxed in. He knows the people that don't admire him will taunt him for not admitting he tried to play the system, so he's obliged to admit to something. And Bruce Springsteen already knows that a guy like me will fully appreciate his predicament and won't hold it against him, that he confessed to bumbling that no-body sees as being egregious or associated with low character.
Doesn't what happened to my friend and his jailed son resonate with you at all? We're men - we're supposed to accept responsibility when in doubt. And everyone else is supposed to actually look at the facts and decide how they feel about what happened. I'm truly sorry you're so poisoned to the guy. And I'm defending this man even though normally, I'd prefer to be entertained by someone other than Bruce Springsteen.Click to expand...
I’m a man of few words ...
Springsteen’s style of music - boring to me
Springsteen the man - not someone that I admire or would associate with
Just my .02 cents
Now to actually watch the video posted by the op lol
I never could figure him out, didn't much care for his voice, and as someone posted above, was: "...just a bar band that got lucky ..." However, over the last 5-6 years, I started listening to his stuff up to Born In The USA (loathe that album). The first 3 albums are phenomenal (IMHO) and Darkness ..... Nebraska and The River are all great stuff as well but (again, IMO) fall short of the first 3. The later stuff I've actually given an honest listen to but all seems just overindulgent and self-indulgent (for lack of better term) "fodder". By the way, his autobiography is quite a good read I'm actually reading it a second time, lots of trials and tribulations, very relatable.
I respect him--great songwriter, legendary performer. But I really don't ever listen to him.
I feel the same about some other artists, including the Beatles. Immensely talented, prolific songwriters, and an all-time iconic band no doubt. But I don't have a single song by them on my playlist.

@william tele, that "accompanying fan" is got to be a ringer. Who shows up at an impromptu busking session (is that the "fan's" bicycle?) by his favorite singer, with a tuned-up 12-string ready to sling, and knowing the chords and words to all the songs?
or was it that the fan was already busking Springsteen stuff on the street when The Boss jumped him?
Not a HUGE fan but I do like some stuff. There's something about this one and I don't know what . I just think it's a great/fun song...

Y'all may not believe me, but I was about ten feet from the center of the stage for that performance, about 4-5 totally squashed rows back. Phoenix, summer of 78 - I was 19 years old and I'd never had more fun that than in my short life. This was the second encore of a totally blissed out dance party that had been going on for HOURS - I think he played a third too. That show, along with another Phoenix/Tempe show in 1980 for some reason were filmed and became pretty legendary as a result. He was that good a lot in those days, but because those two shows were filmed, I can find most of them on Youtube and a lot of people have seen parts of them. My tickets that night were only pretty good, but by the encores I was up front with the crazies. A lot of people over the years have surmised that those girls jumping up on stage was fake, but I can tell you there was nothing fake about it. One of them was about three feet from me and she was losing it and toward the end he just started pushing forward with a few other girls and they converged and climbed up there and took him down. Before he started the next song (I'm thinking it was Quarter to Three by Gary US Bonds - he ended a lot of shows with that in those days), he said something like, 'that girl's tongue was so far down my throat I didn't know if I was gonna make it'. By 80 and 84 they'd learned how to do security and that never coulda happened, but in '78, they were just getting used to playing huge shows everywhere and we were RIGHT up against the stage, and it was only 4 feet high or so.
It was just pure outta hand rock 'n roll FUN and anybody who saw him play in those days and DIDN'T like him, well they just were never gonna. He's become all kinds of symbolic things to all kinds of people since, but back then he was just a newly successful rock star at the height of his powers, feeling' it, out on the road having a total blast. I saw him a few months later in Tucson (my hometown) and it was every bit as great. They played Because the Night with so much energy I nearly passed out during that Tucson show - it seriously felt like the roof was gonna come off of that building. I was at work the next morning and the local FM station was playing a LOT of Bruce and I called the DJ and just started yelling BRUUUUUCE at the top of my lungs into the phone and then he started yelling it back at me, but he was doing it on the radio and then he played about 10 Springsteen songs in a row. Epic times...
Everybody can be hyper-critical about his guitar playing, the bombast, his politics, whatEVER, but shows like those early ones made me a fan for life. I'd been through a guitar-hero phase, was mostly into the blues in those early days of trying to learn to play myself, but shows like that showed me what rock 'n roll was initially supposed to be - just pure over the tops adrenalin based, no inhibitions, dance your ass off FUN. Bruce made that happen again when the music had started taking itself way too seriously. I don't need to go see him anymore and he hasn't made a lot of music I like more than a little bit lately, but that's OK. Neither have the Stones and I still love them too.
I havent read the whole thread, about half of it and I did not see anything relevant.
So, here goes:

That letter is great
I commented previously and I would consider myself a Springsteen fan, but I still find a great deal of his stuff misses the mark. I will go back to saying that he isn't as prolific a songwriter as he could probably be and he isn't very good at editing. He tours a lot which is great for his hardcore fans. Quantity versus quality? Just some high level comparisons on studio LP-type releases:
Springsteen:
18 studio albums
45 years since the release of his first one
2.5 years per album
Dylan:
36 studio albums
56 years since the release of his first one
1.5 years per album
U2:
14 studio albums
38 years since the release of their first one
2.7 years per album
Elvis Costello:
30 studio albums

1.37 years per album​

Disclaimer, I am a Springsteen fan.
I don't think I can name more than 2 Elvis Costello songs.
I am also a U2 fan, them, Dylan and Springsteen miss the mark more often than not.
The one album I would take on a deserted island is Darkness on the Edge of Town
I can tolerate a few songs with content I don't care for, I can even tolerate a few comments of this or that, but a rant can disrupt the flow of every bodies enjoyment. It can change the mood of everyone.
If the event is billed as a concert, that is what it should be. Not a political rally. Paying patrons shouldn't be subjected to a 15, 30 or 60 minute rant.
If it's the spirit of the artist, I can hear that in their music that I paid to hear and not have to listen to a rant. And that goes for artists on both sides of the political aisle. They can save their opinions for that kind of venue. It doesn't always do well to share those opinions if half or more of the patrons are going to be displeased and decide not to be a patron anymore. That doesn't do well for anyone involved.
I still listen to some of his music and enjoy it.

Perhaps it simply isn't possible, to be appreciative of everything. Sometimes, being appreciative of one sort of thing tends to loss of interest in most or all other things.
Borrowed, but never bought a Springsteen album. By comparison, I've listened to Elvis Costello LPs and CDs for something like 10 hours straight, numerous times. It has been decades and decades since I could only name 12 Elvis Costello songs. I can turn the radio on and hear Bruce all I need to.
I don't own everything there is, anymore, by U2, but for example, on the first three LP releases, there's not a single number I've skipped over. None of that is filler. Some Dylan songs don't mesmerize me like other ones do but they're first rate. The only thing that makes me stop listening to a Dylan recording is something like the record being too worn out or damaged.
One of the attributes about some artists, that I admire, is the way listening to them doesn't seem to make listening to something else seem "off". Just anecdotally, I have found Bruce Springsteen devotees lose interest in other performers. What I can't tell you is what is cause and what is effect. All I know is, I like liking a lot of disparate writers and performers - I'm naturally reluctant to reach out if I think the Gravitational Field is too intense.
this was springsteen getting political in 85 it doesn't last for 60 minutes
Whatever

When I got my first CCR record and we started rehearsing these songs and from that point forward, for years, the word was pronounced
Thang.
I was skeptical when they told me John was from California and had never lived near the Mississippi at all. Still, I was a scary good mimic of "John-isms" in front of the mike.
I resolved my own Cultural Disconnect by moving to Louisiana as soon as I could get out of the house.

Btw, I'm not sure what part of what mountains Bruce is supposed to be from, now. Primarily he just stopped sounding like he was from that part of NJ.

I agree. The gravelly voiced songs about factory workers are a little much. I feel like he's one of those guys who would rock an acoustic set of folk songs or non-hits.

Most of the naysayers’ posts sound heavily tinged with jealousy. Hmmmm! He’s probably not a member here, even though he plays a Tele.
Yep. I’m sure none of you would really want to go home to a mansion, or be a household name. That takes too much hard work. Or sell 64.5 million records!! That has to be a mistake, right? Someone didn’t add that up correctly.
I would be willing to bet that half of the members here are more proficient on the guitar than Bruce is. No? But, he made it and you didn’t. That’s just not right. Maybe something unlawful happened there.
How can a guy go from humble beginnings to a major arena sellout entertainer? It must have been a trick or something. That’s it! He has deceived us into thinking that he is someone that he isn’t. Maybe there should be an investigation!

There's a popular canoe livery in Brooklyn, MS, which primarily serves Black Creek, and Black Creek runs from west of to south of Camp Shelby and some of the servicemen would rent canoes and float these stretches of river. And lots of people stopped on the beaches alongside the river to relax. And you might pass and be passed by, some of the other parties on the hours long trips. When it got too hot, you just threw yourself overboard into the tea stained water. The snakes seemed to clear out when the boaters showed up.
And I would say, by speech patterns, we could tell which floaters were in the service and which were not, more than you could always know where someone was from.
There was also Red Creek, and Little Black Creek and Janice Creek and Beaverdam, and some folks went on down the Leaf past the junction, but the Black, immediately upstream and downstream of US 49 was the most popular segment.
We knew someone was training at Shelby, by the big sounds of those explosions from time to time.

OMG. Agreed; it's horrible. That said, he's got HIS music down pat - and when he does THAT, it's vintage Bruce.
His music isn't for everyone, but he's a master showman.
I suspect that most of the people complaining about Bruce's "political lectures" have never actually seen him live. I've seen him quite a few times, and the most I've ever heard of his politics amounted to 5 minutes of a 3+ hour show. Not exactly the stuff of rambling lectures.
When they send me to the deserted island for 20 years, I’m takin Led Zeppelin II, Blood on the Tracks, and Nebraska. In that order.
Ya, know? I'm not sure I ever heard the word "bombastic" used without being a reference to Bruce Springsteen.
I'm going to try and use it more...it's like something is "The Bomb" and at the same time "Fantastic".
In fact, I'm going to see if I can change my image and be more bombastic in everything I do.
Tomorrow I mow the lawn...bombastically.
You’ve obviously never read about queen. Or bat out of hell in particular.

I can't understand this post either! Why denigrate a performer who has written some really great songs, has such a loyal fan base, and has given so much over the decades. I'm not a fan, nor do I own any of his music, but I would never bash him, his fans or even the entire "East Coast".

As I said I am by no means a fan. Never bought anything by him. I will say he’s a prolific song writer ( though very few I like) and he is a tele man. Just goes to show there is something good to find in any one.

The accent is fake, as is everything else about him
When it comes to his music... I'm a big fan. We may or may not see eye-to-eye politically, but who cares? I don't see eye-to-eye politically with half of my friends and family either but that doesn't mean I'm going to stop liking them because of it. As far as guitar talent, he isn't one that comes to mind if someone asks me about guitar greats (though there is no doubt he is exponentially better than I am). I see his guitar as more of a prop than a part of his musicality. It doesn't take away from him being a great musician and entertainer... though I really don't think it adds much either.
Styx, Billy Joel, Barry Maniow and Springsteen............all similar and for me, don't really care for their music.
Boy, tough crowd here. Should I get the pitchforks and torches ready?
I think he's great. Not the greatest or anything, but he's written a bunch of songs that have moved my soul. I've never gone to the trouble of seeing him. YMMV
I hadn't really investigated him till I bought Live in NYC on DVD. It's pretty amazing, especially his 25 minute version of 10th Avenue Freezeout. I can take or leave his recorded stuff but he puts on a great show. I've seen him twice down here, I probably won't see him again as he's pretty expensive and as I get older, I think i wanna save my money for people I've yet to see. But Bruce is definitely The Boss in my book, even if it's all a big act!

Born in the USA and being a draft dodger - a tad hipacritical.Click to expand...
Are you saying he’s hypocritical for dodging the draft and then singing a song called Born In The USA? Because if that’s the case, you haven’t actually listened to the lyrics of the song.
I liked him a lot as a kid. Found a copy of Born to Run and one other one on the side of the road. Then got Born In The USA when it came out. Got Nebraska, Tom Joad, The Rising. Decided I should go see him. Saw the price of tickets and l kind of said “Hmm, this guy claims to represent the regular working guy?” The regular working guy can’t afford your tickets, Bruce. I still like the stuff I like, but the shine wore off after that.
He's had a successful career for over 40 years and you seriously think 2 things make a dent in that.... He's a serious musician that has done very well.... Made more people happy with his music than most of us here put together.... Why not post two things that make him great!
Cheers
Dig the Boss... let the haters hate, their prerogative.
Having said that.... NO one can top this version IMB.

How can a draft dodger singing about going to Vietnam and the plights of a returned vet not be hipocritical? Then there’s the fake blue collar crap. He has a great band, and wrote 1 or 2 good songs, which I couldn’t even name off hand, IMO over rated is an understatement.Click to expand...
To me, musically...........Bruce Springsteen equates to Styx, Billy Joel and Barry Manilow and I can't stand any of them.
I admit I was asking because I was too lazy to go back through 12 pages (on the app) to find out exactly the original idea. Thanks for clarifying, I was legitimately asking.
http://nj1015.com/springsteen-was-a-stone-cold-draft-dodger-and-proud-of-it/
I was a couple years too young for the draft for Vietnam. I had some friends and family who served, some who had deferments and some who dodged. Those folks ALL had their reasons and ALL of them are still friends and remained friends.
As for Springsteen, the article I linked shows a couple of things about him: He is honest that he dodged. He used music to heal himself. He admitted his actions. He has committed millions to helping veterans. While his song was co opted for political purposes outside of his control (and people did not care because many people don't listen and pay attention nor want to hear the whole story...)
Not exactly my perfect definition of a hypocrite... but, we all define these terms our own ways.
Beyond his control - goes to integrity.
SAX anyone?
Well, even IF the guitar was a Tele instead of a Strat, would you notice?

Does she ONLY speak German? She and I wouldn't have much to do if she can't sprecken sie Anglais....
She has great chops, under-utilized, but smooth jazz is about the only place sax fits in commercially.
That's hilarious, been using sax players in most my bands for decades they are usually the hit of the live shows.
I think Bruce disagees as well. I think alot of guitar solos that are long duration note melodies would be better on Sax.

Assuming the actual same phrases, might that be because we've all heard too durn much guitar and the sax sounds kinda fresh?
Lately, the fates have put sax players into my gigs lately.
I’m going to have a long talk with the fates!

An antigua Strat at that ! ... ouch.
I was there in the 80s when saxophones were over used everywhere.
These are what impress me at gigs:

Yes! Sax! My father played. He owned a Selmer Mark VI Tenor. I heard plenty of it. But anyway a cool Sax solo I heard in this Modern Swing Song. The group is called the Swingrowers. They are a Italian group. I dig the Bass Synth when it kicks in. The lady has a killer voice, cool guitarist, and a terrific sax solo. Entertaining video for sure. Enjoy!

 Tom Schulz got a passable long note tone, but any Metal or other ballad w a sustaining solo almost always lacks the big sound stage of a sax. Just more 3D w a sax, the timbre changes, vibrato, and tremlo can be manipulated better.

Yeah I used to play saxes and really miss all the nuance you can add withing the note, as well as the distance between noted being zero because you just squeeze the right keys and you're there without going anywhere.
Plus the speedy nature of phrasing!
Plus the range of sweet to raunchy tones with no pedals!
I guess I try to phrase guitar with some of the fluidity of sax, and also use various Muff and fuzz variants to get a more saxy sustain.
Actually I also use extreme volume and heavy muting to get the note rise a sax can deliver, where the volume drives the strings and I mute them back, so the envelope can be less guitary and more saxy.
Still though, I really love electric guitar!
And electric cello/ violin!
And drums!
Durn body got all beat up from hard use and now all I can keep up on is guitar...
I also like the underbelly of sax used in this tune:
Candy Dulfer is Dutch. She puts on an amazing show-- watch some of her other YouTube offerings.
Overall I think sax is fantastic as a solo instrument. You can bend notes with the reed and using breath and embouchure you
can put all kinds of nuance into every note. There's a reason why many of jazz's titans were sax players....
I also think the ergonomics of the saxophone tend to favor certain phrasing approaches that have really become the standard lingo for
most jazz. There's a lot more guitar players trying to figure out how to emulate classic sax licks than there are sax players trying to emulate
classic guitar licks, that's for certain.
Candy Dulfer (born 19 September 1969) is a Dutch pop, funk alto saxophonist and occasional singer who began playing at the age of six. She founded her band, Funky Stuff, when she was fourteen years old. Her debut album Saxuality (1990) received a Grammy nomination. Dulfer has released eleven studio albums, two live albums, and one compilation album. She has performed and recorded songs with musicians including her father Hans Dulfer, Prince, Dave Stewart, Van Morrison, Angie Stone, and Maceo Parker, and has performed live with Alan Parsons (1995), Pink Floyd (1990), and Tower of Power (2014). She hosted the Dutch television series Candy meets... (2007), in which she interviews fellow musicians. In 2013 she became a judge in the fifth season of the Dutch version of X Factor.

George has a story about apologizing to the brass about altering their sound w distortion. Brass is a pretty broad term , but I thought he meant typical Trumpets, French Horns and other brass that they would use on Penny Lane, Hello Goodbye etc. I can t think of a Sax anywhere else on a Beatles record.
Sax is not considered a brass instrument. It's a reed instrument. Trumpet, Trombone, cornet, flugelhorn, French horn, tuba, trombone, euphonium (small tuba)....if it doesn't have a trumpet-like
mouthpiece then it isn't brass. At least I think I'm right about that...go ahead and correct me if not....

Right about brass, but the sax family is the woodwinds, which includes flute and recorder etc.
Same math to the bore and tone holes, so once you learn to play one it's logical to learn others.
'Cept bassoon which has half the keys in backwards order!
these guys used a lot of Sax...
Yeah, I suppose it's a woodwind even though it's not made of wood. It's interesting-- I played clarinet for several years before playing sax. Sax is actually easier to finger because
the octave fingerings are exactly the same. On a clarinet, the lowest octave is fingered quite differently from the second octave.
I once played in a "wind band", aka "concert band". All instruments are played by blowing into them, except the drums. Basically like a symphony orchestra minus all strings. Lots more clarinets and flutes to make up for the lack of strings.
I think that they put the camera on the guitarist too much.
She should be in Diana Krall's band. They look similar.
For those that don't know, Candy Dulfer is a very charismatic front woman who can also sing. Here she is kicking butt in some kick-butt thigh high boots--
I've always loved Jerome Richardson's solo in "Dirty Work"... dragging just enough to make it funky... the underlying sax parts are cool too. Solo starts around 2:10...

I saw him in the early '70's in D.C. and they played Born to Run about a year before the album came out. Clarance played the opening guitar part on the sax; guitar was later used in the recording. I liked it with the sax.

My sax playing inspiration was more Jazz but you can't skip the cool grinding rasp of R&B/ soul/ blues and yeah even rock sax.
This is one reason I dislike the cliche "jazz guitar" sound.
So many ways to play Jazz, why repeat old tone in new music?
Sax man here, although I only get to play once in a while, because of the volume.
I took lessons for two years from an excellent teacher. It’s a Yamaha student model, with a Vandoran mouthpiece.
Worst amp ever ... (apologies if this thread already exists)
I love Fender.
But I was getting rid of some stuff lately, and took a Fender Princeton 65 DSP to the charity shop because I wouldn't have been able to face myself if I sold it on to somebody in good faith.
I think it was the same price as a Peavey Bandit 112 when I bought it, but shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath.
Disgusting quality.
Aesthetically, it looked pretty good, but everything else about it purely sucked.
I guess I just stuck it in a cupboard years ago, and selectively forgot about it.
Any thoughts on the worst amps you've ever played?
Personally, the worst I ever played was a second generation/version of a Blues Junior. Played it for 10 years because I absolutely had to have a tube amp and couldn’t afford anything else at the time (also I didn’t know about affordable non-Fender/solid state options). It always sounded boxy and muddy overdriven (pedal or amp) and thin and sterile clean. Eventually, I bought a Peavey Bandit as a backup but both I and my bandmates thought it sounded better than the Blues Jr. The Blues Jr became the backup to the Bandit instead and I ended up selling it after I got a good deal on a PRRI.
That’s just my opinion, I know the Blues Jr gets a lot of love. I played a Blues Jr III or IV as a backline amp at a gig a few years later and I thought it sounded better than the one I had, but not enough to wish I owned one again.
I’ve played a few amps in store or at jams that had so many controls that I didn’t know how to make it make a good sound. Can’t remember what the brand/model names of those ones, though.

Anything from Crate. I've had 4 or 5, all bought used, and every single one was defective. Frustrating.
The worst amp I've ever owned was a Heathkit 2x12 SS combo I found on the curb on trash day. I grabbed it thinking it may have some decent speakers in it. Turned out the no-name speakers were blown, but the amp portion worked fine.
I found some Realistic 12" speakers at a hamfest for $5 each and stuck 'em in there. The amp was two channels (not switchable) and had volume and tone controls and a tremolo that was terrible. I replaced the torn-up grill cloth and painted a name badge on the front: Barking Spider. This was 15 years before Line 6 came out with their Spider amp. Trendsetting is a thankless job
A few years later a pal of mine named Rick said he loved the lo-fi tone of the thing, so I gave it to him. If you know a guy named Rick who also goes by the nickname 'Guido' and plays through a Heathkit Barking Spider amp, that's the one!

This is, almost, my story as well. Minus the Bandit. I had 3 years of it before I went to the Superchamp modelers. and never looked back.
Line 6 Spider 1v 75. Absolutely dreadful amp, especially when you get into the distortion settings.
Note: The Bandit makes for a great poweramp combo for a modelling board. I've used mine with a Line 6 POD XT Live patched into the 'Pwr Amp In' jack, I use the POD for all controls. It was markedly better when I swapped out the Sheffield speaker for a Celestion 70/80. It's a much smoother and neutral sounding speaker and it didn't colour the tone as much as the stock speaker. YMMV
When our band started gigging at parties and such I needed a bigger amp than the tiny 1x8 tube powered Lero I started on.
So the salesman talked my father into buying a 200W 2x12 Gibson amplifier. I knew nothing about gear back then, but Gibson was the deeeluxe name in guitars, so I was thrilled.
It had "harmonic multiplier" distortion and an onboard phase shifter.
Ten tons of solid state crap that I dragged around for years until I just left it in somebody's studio somewhere.
I have a friend who has one of those Fender DSP amps. He never plays it. The single time I heard him play it, it didn't sound terrible to my ear. Of the readily available and relatively popular commercial amps that I've played the Blues Junior takes the cake for the biggest stinker I've played also.

There's a lot of Bandit love so far . .
This is making me want to get one all over again, but I think the missus would kill me if I bought any more amps for a while . .
Maybe I can find one that needs some fixing-up for a 'lockdown project'. . .
The worst amp EVER, the Peavey Bandit 112 hands down. I would rather go playing bare amp or drums before using that crap again
We've covered this a half-dozen times, but here are mine again. Both were in the '90s.
1. The smallest Crate practice amp that was built like a wooden crate. Got it in a trade. It smoked and died with a noise like a bug being strangled. It smoked, one day, and went into the trash.
2. One of those little Gorilla practice amps. Paid $20 for it. The tone could be varied between nasty and the sound of spoons in a garbage disposal. Smoked and trashed.
Crate VC508. I got it new very cheap from auction. Horrible in every way. But it did give me my first taste of amp tinkering and modding. So there’s that.

As for the Fender DSP... I'm not a fan, but if you watch Joe Walsh playing "At Daryl's House", he's playing through a DSP 212 - and he sounds just like Joe Walsh. So what do I know?
In the mid 1980's I bought a Dean Markley amp on the recommendation of some sales guy somewhere. This was back before the days of the internet, YouTube videos and product reviews, other than Guitar Player magazine. Spent a good amount of money for a very harsh, solid state-sounding tube amp...couldn't get rid of it fast enough.
A Crate or something practice amp in the 80s, I guess - in more modern times I've been happy with stuff I have owned. I always hated blues jrs, but then I played a couple shows with one as a backline and they actually sounded pretty good in those settings. Maybe it was just that one. Currently I am hating the Reissue Twin in my rehearsal space, there's no way to get the tone I want out of it without pedals, and it seems to be frying another tube again.

When I was 12 I discovered that I could plug a piezo on my classical guitar into an 8-track tape deck, crank the output volume on the tape deck, and keep the volume on my receiver low, and produce distortion. It was unspeakably horrible, but I still felt like Prometheus.

Worst amp I ever played through was my daughter-in-law’s Line 6 Spider 15. It defines bees-in-a-can distortion. I gave her a Fender Champion 20 for Christmas a couple of years ago; she likes it a lot better, as do I.
Those Princeton 65 DSP and the non-DSP predecessors - along with the Deluxe 85/90’s, Princeton Chorus, etc. - are improved greatly by putting a “volume box” in the effects loop. It throttles the signal from the preamp to the power amp, allowing the amp’s volume and tone controls to be set to provide better tone, while still allowing reasonable volume levels. The power amps in those older SS Fender models are very clean, and very powerful for their size. All the tone comes from the preamp, and without some way to reduce the signal level to the power amp, the best tones that preamp can produce are unusable in small settings. The “volume box” solves that problem.
I understand that commercial versions sell for about $40 USD. I’ve made four of them for friends for under $10 USD each. Takes basic soldering skills and drilling three holes in a plastic project box. Add two short instrument cables, and you’re all set.
A good friend loves his Princeton 65. He’s used it to play everything from tiny bars to the old Hollywood, FL bandshell on the beach. A drive pedal in front, and he’s good to go. Sound guys love the simplicity of his rig.
crate SS with 2x8 speakers. i gave it to my nephew for a while but he didn't even like it. so i pulled the chassis and use the the remains as an extension cab. sounds great with two british celestions.
play music!
Is this a thread designed to push some used amp prices down? I'm all for that ... well, until I want to sell an amp. I won't mention which amp I'm thinking about selling.
Ii had a Yamaha G50-210 solid state amp in the early 80's' like this one. I'm sorry if you have one and like yours but to me, this thing was a dog. I couldn't find any settings that sounded good for any genre or guitar I played through it.
oh man. I see some amps I have played before and thought were okay.
This is like 'worst song' threads... the glaring obvious range of bad amps that were just torture.... the Gorilla. There really isn't anything worse. I defy the world to produce the one guy who says, 'oh man, I LOVE my Gorilla amp, I still use it.'
Gorilla
EDIT: You beat me to it!
I had a Fender M80 in the late eighties/early nineties- Grey indoor/outdoor carpet. Objectively, it was terrible- lifeless, fuzzy built in distortion, etc. But I kind of have fond feelings for it now. not that I'm in the market or anything...
It would probably have to be my Gorilla GG-25, my very first amp -- though I later came to appreciate its charms in a nostalgic way. After it basically fell apart my bandmates and I discovered it could function as a sickening pre-amp that gave incredible, gnarly Paul Leary-like distorted tones when plugged into bigger speakers.
ETA: I bought a GG-20 off FB Marketplace last year for $25 just to scratch that nostalgia itch. Still haven't plugged it in!

I had one and it was terrible. I was at my neighborhood shop one day and the owner had me talk to a rep about my amp. I told him it sounded ****ty, was weak and gutless, and the worst amp I had ever owned. He walked out of the store red in the face, unable to talk.
The store owner said, "Good Job. That was Richard Krueger."Click to expand...

Now I have the 100 watt stereo GK 250 ML . I used it to Mike acoustic guitar and ran it through two Yamaha pa mains. Somewhat better. Built in echo and reverb, it gives an authentic 80s sound.

Whoah! Is that a Quantum? Don’t I remember a whole line of those in the Musician’s Friend catalogs back in the late 80s? I vaguely remember being tempted by the tiny halfstack-looking one when I had not yet moved past my Peavey practice amp.

John Hagen used one with Lyle back in early days, & i didn't hate how he used it, so i started thinking about Lee's Rickenbacker and vocal tone & just decided i didn't like Rush's chosen timbre . . .
For me, the worst amp I ever had was a late 1970s solid state Peavey Musician.
I've owned/used/played/built a lot of amps.
I had one of these Acoustic amps back in high school, which was really horrid sounding....
worst amp I ever owned is a tie between a Gorilla practice amp and a 4x10 version of that solid-state Yamaha up there. but the amp I learned to hate the most was the early version of the solid-state Marshall stack. Ungodly loud, bright and shrill. Back when I was in the sound business, I'd know it was going to be a long night when somebody dragged one of these onstage.

The worst amp I've ever owned was a Heathkit 2x12 SS comboClick to expand...
I think I had the same amp! I acquired it from a buddy in college. While I didn't think it was THAT bad, it certainly wasn't great. Definitely not as good as the old Baldwin C1 I used through high school, but better than the crap amp the other guitarist in my band used. (What was that? Marlboro? Can't remember.)
Most disappointing was a Mesa DC-3 head. I went from being a Boogie fanboy to losing all interest after that.
In the 80s, I had a Twin Reverb that somebody had "modded" to make the vibrato into an extra gain control. Such a mistake. I wish I had known a tech who could fix it, I might still be using it today.
Fender Frontman 25. It wasn't bad, per se. I was just really disappointed.
Another vote for an older (2002-03) Blues Jr. Couldn't wait to get rid of it. Thin, harsh, lousy sound.
I rented a Crate back in the early '80s and it was a POS. Also had a guy short on cash give me a Line 6 Spider II a few years ago. The canned tones seemed like they belonged in an '80s SS. I traded it for an Epi LP Special II.
Vox Valvetronix ad30vt for small gigs and ....a Vox AC30vr. Both were disappointing in all aspects.
Fender Red Knob 1X12 Super 60. Clean channel was OK. Overdrive channel was utter garbage. The thing weighed a tonne for it's size and was an unreliable misery. Ended up just giving it away I was so sick of looking at it.
Had one crate----just dull and lifeless.
Played a Standell in a music store back in the late 60s. Worst reverb I ever heard.
Radio Shack practice amp. The less said the better.
Ibanez ToneBlaster 150. Just like a few Solid State heads I tried out-----almost no volume on the clean channel, no tone on the dirt channel.
Almost forgot, I bought one of the first Lunchbox Club amps with the 12" speaker. Low volume, no usable tones, re-boxed it and returned within 30 minutes. Slammed a review, then learned that the first issue was defective and they hopefully were improved.
Any 60s Gibson/Epiphone amp---what were they thinking?
Solid-state Marshalls---ditto.
Any of the 'Blues' series Fenders---they've only gotten worse.
Custom Vibrolux Reverb---no NFB (the Zinky signature), ugly midrangey blattblattblatt.
I'll take a Bandit 65 anyday over any of these.
It's a stretch, but...
My first "amp" setup consisted of:
- Zoom 505 -> 1/4" to 1/8" adapter -> 3.5" to cassette adapter
- Cassette adapter -> JVC audio head unit powered by PC Power Supply
- JVC Audio head unit -> 3-way 6x9" speakers
The PC Power supply didn't have enough juice on the 12V line, so if I hit the strings hard it would brown out and shut off.
I second the comments on Peavey Bandits, and the original Crate amps. I remember when I first started....every amp I played sounded terrible...because of my playing back then.
I've always heard that solid state amps were horrible, but the Roland JC120's I've played are amazing sounding and take cruch pedals well, though they're supposedly made for "jazz". Ooooh, lah-dy frickin dah, he says, with his pinky finger held erect away from his mocha latte. Dimebag played SS Kranks the majority of his career, but I believe they (KRANK) made a tube amp for him toward the end of his life that he swore by.
The worst sound I ever got from one of my amps was a 1981 Fender Super Twin Reverb, black face/grille, all tube. The 180W, 100+lb beast had a "Distortion" section on its far right side that sounded like both speakers were sliced and diced with small pieces of gravel bouncing off the cones. Not cool, like the Dave Davies' "You really got me" slits on his amp. Supposedly the S.T. Reverb makes great clean loud sonics for pedal steel use. I've also heard the Fender Frontman blackface 212's are dreadful, but haven't actually tried one.
Cheers
I think It is not fair to mention cheap SS crap, they are in a different league.
SS: The worst ever for me, Orange Crush 30. Fuzzy and harsh, unable to produce volume ir any other tone than a farty mid-heavy mess. My 15w Behringer was better
Tube: Sound-wise, Marshall MA50. Not a single usables Channel. Sounded like a MG. **** speakers, fizzy icepick overdrive, lifeless cleans.
Reliability-wise: Bugera 6260 non infinium
I thought Bandits had a cult following. I played through one only once at a church, and was amazed... It was a large teal stripe... At least I am pretty sure it was a bandit.
Interesting the disdain for princeton amps as well, must be lemons because those amps are a fan favorite... I might upgrade to one in the future.
My tone isn't perfect for sure, but it seems to work for me. The bedroom level thing limits my amp availability. But I won't play a super small amp either. The junior is the perfect size for me. And it sounds great as long as I keep the treble down a bit.. Although I've noticed that if I dime the tone knobs on it, my ear adjusts, and my neck pickup sounds deeper than my bridge, and I don't notice the change in tone.
Worst amps were I guess the ones I played before I knew any better. But they worked for the time. I bought a gorilla once and got totally ripped off for it... It was horrible... I gave it to good will. The line 6 was a good beginner amp, but I wouldn't touch one after being exposed to tube amps.
I tried a bugera in the store and it was tinny compared to my junior. Plus cosmetically I like the knobs on the hot rod deluxe/junior style amps... I don't like bugera or peavey logos that much.
The new bandit looks great, and from videos seems to sound great too. That and the roland blues cube hot seem nice. But I like tube amps a lot, and if I had to upgrade, this one is looking like the one to get.
Seems though, the crowd is mixed whether this will work in a bedroom or not.

I think there's a big difference between a Princeton and a Princeton DSP.
I'm sure a lot of the Princetons are beautiful sounding, authentic amplifiers.
The DSP was just a box of cheap filth.

Line 6 Spider 1v 75. Absolutely dreadful amp, especially when you get into the distortion settings.Click to expand...
You're talking about the original Spider 1X12 combo, right?
That was the worst one for me, too. I couldn't get the clean models to sound anything above fair. What should have been like mid-gain dirty stuff were as buzzy and bad as the high gain stuff, which was totally unusable for me.
I think it had like 12 different models? And you could assign 4 of them to memory. How it was not possible to even find a single one that sounded just slightly fair is slightly unbelievable. Also, I recall all of the effects as just not sounding good, at all.
I had a little Peavey Rage 158 - early TransTube model (V1), that I only use for practicing. It had a crappy little speaker and almost zero features. It even lacked everything that the bigger TransTube stuff had. Despite all that, it was a great sounding amp compared to the Line 6 Spider. I practiced with it regularly for at least a couple of years.
The other really odd thing about the Line 6 Spider is that it actually came with a Celestion Seventy 80 in it. I took the speaker out and still have it to this day. I put some rebranded Eminence speaker in the Spider as a last ditch effort, and tried to reduce the gain on all the models as much as possible. It still sucked really hard.
I never had a Gorilla amp, but honestly believe that the V1 Spider could really give it a run for its money, just with a lot more options as to how to get really bad sounds. And the Spider does (or did) it at 4X the cost.

Yup. Just horrible. The 'Insane' setting was really just that, and no, not in a good way. The effects sounded hollow and tinny and they had near zero tweakability.
I think the 70/80 was the one smart thing they did. I reckon that it's a good modelling speaker, just because it's so neutral sounding.

80% of my hatred for Rush involves Lifeson using those (GK) amps.Click to expand...
Whether or not you like Iron Maiden, at least I thought they had a really good distorted amp sound..up until they started using GK amps, and only after they ditched them. It's like every good tonal quality that they had was strangled and drowned out by the GK amps.
When I think of 'bad 80's SS amp sounds', I immediately think of the Rush and I.M. songs that used those GK amps. In the case of I.M., at least it's just mostly confined to a couple of studio albums. But with Rush, there are live recordings that I still have a hard time listening to, today.
IMO, the other big tragedy is that the writing and song structures for Seventh Son of a Seventh Son are actually pretty good (if classic British metal floats your boat at all). But those GK amp tones really reduce the overall greatness of that studio album recording, IMO.

I agree. I got a warehouse damaged Line 6 4X12 for next to nothing, just to harvest the four Seventy 80s out of it. I managed to rebuild the damaged cabinet successfully, but that was just a small bonus.
I'm guessing that subsequent low end combos from Line 6 have gotten better, but I don't even want to try them now.
A friend had a Peavey Decade 10 watts of solidstate trash tone. I once offered him 20.00 to let me shoot it with a 12 gauge.
The Peavey Bandit I had in 1980 or 1981 was pretty bad. I loved it, but now know it was really, really awful.
My plywood kit guitar with dual Super Distortion humbuckers and multiple DPDT switches ( and extra holes after I moved 'em ) must have sounded just horrendous with it.
We learn.
I was going to say my green-board Blues Jr, but I own worse... an Epiphone Electar Tube 10. It’s a neat idea, but the tone was never there. I bought it new in ’99 because of the Internet buzz about it.
Thank goodness I learned better — largely due many of you posting here.

Personally, the worst I ever played was a second generation/version of a Blues Junior. Played it for 10 years because I absolutely had to have a tube amp and couldn’t afford anything else at the time (also I didn’t know about affordable non-Fender/solid state options). It always sounded boxy and muddy overdriven (pedal or amp) and thin and sterile clean. Eventually, I bought a Peavey Bandit as a backup but both I and my bandmates thought it sounded better than the Blues Jr. The Blues Jr became the backup to the Bandit instead and I ended up selling it after I got a good deal on a PRRI.
That’s just my opinion, I know the Blues Jr gets a lot of love. I played a Blues Jr III or IV as a backline amp at a gig a few years later and I thought it sounded better than the one I had, but not enough to wish I owned one again.
I’ve played a few amps in store or at jams that had so many controls that I didn’t know how to make it make a good sound. Can’t remember what the brand/model names of those ones, though.Click to expand...
I got one of those Blues Jrs in a trade from a friend. We're still friends.
I never liked the sound of any Blues Jr, but since I had it, I learned how to make it sound good. Didn't need to go as far as Bill M mods, but I put some effort into it. It works as a backup to the SF Princeton. Meh.
1970 (I think) Fender Scorpio 2x12 50w SS. These are very rare these days, with good reason: thin, ice picky highs and no warmth to the mids and lows, not to mention butt ugly. It was very loud, however. It was this characteristic that allowed me to trade it for a 1967 BF Pro Reverb, a fairly good trade, IMHO.

However, what is entry level? Mustang I and II I would say, which are decent little amps. LT25? Champion 50? Blues Jr? Hmmm, like them all or not, those are some decent units. You are absolutely right!
I had a Princeton Chorus red knob for years. When I rarely played for years, it was barely enough. It was sterile, the Chorus never was very strong (I think it was defective), reverb was not very good, and the overdrive was harsh. It got me by for decades though.
In 2019 I gave it to the son of a family friend. He was happy just to have something, and he had a friend that loved to tinker with electronics and was looking forward to fixing / improving it. Match made in heaven. If they destroyed it, I would not feel bad, and they were out $0.

Love the GK mini Bass amp with 1x12 in the metal cab. Great for quieter Bass and also for keys. Maybe Bass amp designers are not such good guitar amp builders.

In the mid 1980's I bought a Dean Markley amp on the recommendation of some sales guy somewhere. This was back before the days of the internet, YouTube videos and product reviews, other than Guitar Player magazine. Spent a good amount of money for a very harsh, solid state-sounding tube amp...couldn't get rid of it fast enough.Click to expand...
I had two Dean Markley amps: a 60 watt tube amp, that sounded pretty good, very loud through 1x12, and a 1x12 100 watt SS amp that sounded very tubey and warm, but was about as loud as a Princeton. The SS amp was a great Jazz amp. Sold the tube amp, SS amp eventually failed ... not worth fixing.
Remember the Marshall Valvestate series?
I was given a Marshall VS40 1x10 combo in trade for guitar tech work; that amp was pretty craptacular, but not as bad as the Heathkit was.

The transformer hummed loudly.
As soon as you put a signal through it, it sounded like an aeroplane was taking off, even completely clean.
The volume control was one of those which went from inaudible to stratospheric, with nothing in between.
Anything after that felt too loud in the mids, and it didn't really have much in the way of bass.
The effects didn't sound too bad for what it was, but overall it sounded like sonic cardboard.
I was using an LP through it, so maybe if I put something with single coils through it - it might have offered some better results.
So many to choose from it’s hard to decide. The Mesa Boogie DC5 is a total pile of feces as is the Vox AC4.
I also had a boutique crapfest: it was the Victoria Champ clone, don’t remember the model number but Crap5 would serve it well.
My first guitar amp was bought from Tesco. It had an amp head (transistor) featuring reverb and separate speaker cabinet.
I used to 'drop' the head to get interesting reverberations !
I actually loved the amp I could actually plug in my electric guitar and make noise !
I suspect though that this was the worst amp I ever owned. My next amp was an old Carlsbro valve combo amp with 2 x 12 Celestion Greenbacks. I then part traded this for a Mesa Boogie MK1V in 1990.
A Roland Cube, it was a long long time ago however, 80's
I had a Selmer early 70s then an Intermusic Imp.Both were dreadful.
Epiphone Valve Jr...... I just never got any sound out of it that was pleasant to me.

The Blues Jr (I have a III) is a great amp and it has that little "voxy" touch in the upper mids/hi-s. So if you are a Marshall guy and you hate AC30s jingle jangle ...you'll probably have mixed emotions about the BJr.
You have to be careful with the poweramp and find the right sweetspot of saturation...and you can play with low gain preamp tubes like 12AU7s or weaker EL84/BIAS etc for more clean headroom
Besides that perhaps your amp had a problem...

Quantum Terminator 15
I know this because my first amplifier was a Quantum Terminator 25R. The distortion sounded like broken guitar picks shaken around in a milk jug. I've been looking for a schematic of that amp for quite some time, just out of curiosity. Maybe I could build a nasty distortion pedal out of its preamp.
My most disappointing was the Carvin Bel Air.
For years, as a longtime Guitar Player magazine subscriber ( 30 years!) I used to see the ads for the Carvin Bel Air and Nomad amps, in the back of every issue.
" all tube, 50 watts, 2X12" Vintage style speakers, 2 Channels, Reverb, tweed look..."
direct from Carvin, maybe $349.00 or $399, I forget, but on paper, the amp and the price sounded perfect! I lusted for these amps, as they seemed like great tube amp values.
So after actually getting a '67 Fender Pro Reverb ( and gigging lots, but having maintenance issues with it) for a few years and getting some $$, in the mid '90's I bought a Carvin Bel Air, as a backup to my Pro.
Could NOT do anything with it!
- a clangy edgy clean tone with an upper midrange spiky overtone you could not dial out ( this may have been crappy speakers, but I did not think this back then), and a fizzy OD channel
Total mess of an amp, at least for me.
Sold it after a year towards another amp, at my local shop.
* OTOH, I loved my Carvin PA gear!

It's a stretch, but...
My first "amp" setup consisted of:
- Zoom 505 -> 1/4" to 1/8" adapter -> 3.5" to cassette adapter
- Cassette adapter -> JVC audio head unit powered by PC Power Supply
- JVC Audio head unit -> 3-way 6x9" speakers
The PC Power supply didn't have enough juice on the 12V line, so if I hit the strings hard it would brown out and shut off.Click to expand...
Ha. Our High School band's first "PA" was a noname Radio Shack mike through a JVC tape Deck with a built in amp and a couple of 200 pound early 80's floor-standing Advent Stereo speakers.
What the hell did we know, we were just trying to bash out some Who songs to impress the girls...

Whether or not you like Iron Maiden, at least I thought they had a really good distorted amp sound..up until they started using GK amps, and only after they ditched them. It's like every good tonal quality that they had was strangled and drowned out by the GK amps.
When I think of 'bad 80's SS amp sounds', I immediately think of the Rush and I.M. songs that used those GK amps. In the case of I.M., at least it's just mostly confined to a couple of studio albums. But with Rush, there are live recordings that I still have a hard time listening to, today.
IMO, the other big tragedy is that the writing and song structures for Seventh Son of a Seventh Son are actually pretty good (if classic British metal floats your boat at all). But those GK amp tones really reduce the overall greatness of that studio album recording, IMO.Click to expand...
Regarding Maiden, are you referring to (specifically) Somewhere In Time and Seventh Son? My understanding (and I'm willing to have you correct me) is that the tone on those albums were mostly Adrian Smith's fascination with Roland signal processing gear and Roland guitar synths. I feel like it worked better on SiT, but Seventh Son is definitely a tragedy.
It also took me some years to realize that the writing and riffs on Seventh Son were phenomenal. It's just too bad that all the guitar tones were so shrouded in mist like a meatloaf fart in the shower. Some of the remasters of Megadeth albums have really improved them, so I was hoping for a remaster of some Maiden albums that could maybe undo some of the post-processing stuff, if possible. Instead, they got remastered and re-released in the 90s and were just made 'loud' with a brick wall limiter.
I do remember the ads in some guitar magazine of both Murray and Smith standing next to a Gallien Krueger stack and thinking "maybe that's what I need to sound like the tracks on Live After Death". Maybe it's good that 14-year old me didn't have the dinero to dump on one.

My worst was my first. I got it in 1964. It was a Sears Silvertone Twin Twelve, the one where the head stores away in the bottom of the 2x12 cabinet. It was loud and had a cool looking pilot light. That's the best I can say about it. The sound was a disappointment from the get go, but it was enough amp to get into a band with. The other guitarist in that band had a pretty crappy amp too. But several months later he shows up to rehearsal with a Fender Super Reverb. Holy Moly! That really opened my eyes (and ears). In those days at least, if you wanted quality, you had to pay the piper, and I have ever since.

That's f***ed up.
I can almost smell that.
I was very fortunate in the amp department. I never owned what I consider a bad amp. I had a little Gibson solid state GA-5 to start out but that doesn't count. I saved hard for my first amp, a Music Man RD-50. It was $350.00 new, which was a chunk of change for a youngster. Most of my friends had Peavey amps. I hated those things. Peavey went on to make some fine amps, but not so much in the 1980s. Later I got some assorted Fenders: Princeton Reverb, Pro Junior and Bandmaster. Now it's just my trusty old '77 SFPR. I avoided the Blues Junior, which most of my friends have. I don't hate them but not my first choice in a Fender.
I can say that I've ever owned a bad amp. I guess I'm lucky that way.
Ultralinear silverface master volume** 1977 Fender Twin Reverb.
Loud, shrill, loud, brittle, loud, screechy, loud, heavy and loud.
Not “Loud in a Good Way.”
I bought it in ignorance.
I paid for an education.
I was able to break even on my investment due to my immense charm and the (confounding) desire of the buyer to separate me from this amp.
**I have nothing against silverface/master volume amps—in fact, one of my favorite amps to pass through my herd was a silverface/master volume 1972 Bassman Ten...but this Twin Reverb was horrible.

Whatever works!
My first "PA" for practices was a Squier SP-10 that I modified with spring-type speaker connections to run the same two 3-way 6x9" speakers in parallel (2 ohm load!), fed from my $60 mixer. The amp blew up for some reason?
My first "Stage Monitor" setup was a Sony EXPLODE 22 Watt per channel car audio amp, that I ran from a heavier-duty 12V Power supply (purchased to run my "first amp" setup in my first post) into those same 3-way 6x9 speakers. My roomate used this same setup when he wanted to record some demos in college- he used the Car Power amp and 6x9s as studio monitors.

Europe, 1973, I rented an Ampeg amp in France. I recall it was 6x10 speakers (great sounding combo tube amp), but I haven't been able to find it in Ampeg amp archives. Was I dreaming? I know it wasn't 4x10 ... it was huge. Barely fit in the Peugeot we rented.
In recent years, it would definitely have to be the Fender Vibrolux Reverb (1979-1980) that I thought I had to have, after listening to everyone's glowing love for those. It was the worst sounding, shrill, anemic piece of junk I had ever owned. I had bought a Peavey Classic 30 about the same time, and the Classic 30 played circles around the Vibrolux. That was an expensive lesson hard-earned. It's the only Fender amp I've ever owned that I didn't like and couldn't bond with, even after various tube and speaker changes to attempt to "fix" its sound.
The first bad amp I ever owned was when I was 11 years old. A school mate had sold me a Military power amp that was sitting in an old large Magnavox phonograph. It was big, ugly and sounded terrible. I played thru it for almost a year before getting my first real amp.

Admittedly, by the time that Seventh Son came out (early '88) I wasn't really listening to much stuff like that ('classic British metal', or whatever you want to call it). I actually went as far as Powerslave ('84), but was already losing attention with Live After Death ('85). So by the time that Somewhere In Time came out ('86), I had limited interest, and actually hearing it for the first time didn't help at all.
At first, I think it wasn't even immediately an issue of bad guitar tones on S.I.T., as it was the guitar synth stuff you mentioned. It was just bizarre to me, because the liner notes to Piece of Mind contained the following: "No synthesizers or ulterior motives". Anyway, I also recall that Judas Priest's Turbo was also released the same year, and also had synth stuff on it. They both just lost me, because those albums just sounded vastly different from what they'd done previously.
So it really was in retrospect, for the most part, that I discovered that those two specific I.M. albums used GK amps. I'd actually heard some of the songs off those albums, over and over again, years later, on subsequent live albums (e.g. some time after '00). So then when I went back and listened to all the studio stuff in its entirety, I realized just how bad the guitar tones were, and how different they were from everything that came before or after.

Back in the 90s, I stepped past a brand new '63 Vibroverb RI Fender on the showroom floor to get to the Fender Super 60, also brand new. Came home with the latter.
That was the single dumbest thing I've done musically, ever. The Super 60 was easily the worst amp I've ever owned. Tried hard to give it away and finally succeeded.

The transformer hummed loudly.
As soon as you put a signal through it, it sounded like an aeroplane was taking off, even completely clean.
The volume control was one of those which went from inaudible to stratospheric, with nothing in between.
Anything after that felt too loud in the mids, and it didn't really have much in the way of bass.
The effects didn't sound too bad for what it was, but overall it sounded like sonic cardboard.
I was using an LP through it, so maybe if I put something with single coils through it - it might have offered some better results.Click to expand...
You had me at “hummed loudly”. Similar to the Blues DeVille I traded in for the same reason.
Thanks for responding.
Depends how you define “worst.” Here are my candidates:
1) JC-120. I hated it, and it made my ears bleed. Obviously, a great amp for other people, and maybe I’d feel differently now, 40 years and much guitar later.
B) Vox DA-5. I thought it would be convenient for practice and portability. It was, but it was so poorly made, that it didn’t hold up to even my mild use.
III) Harmony H303C. 1965 radio circuit amp made of pressboard. It makes a noise. Sometimes, that’s the noise I need to make. But it looks cool. Yes, it’s terrible, but I’ll never part with it because I love how it looks. Now, with the speaker from the DA-5 in it, it’s the speaker cab for my...

Got my M-80 new in 1990 for $329 from our local music store. Used it for years but not much anymore. Always loved the clean channel, o.d. not so much.
Fender DSP 25......it was terrible....then I decided to put a 10" Ragin Cajin in it that I had laying around........wow!.....then my son took it to Georgia with him and won't give it back
Blackstar S1 50w head
without a doubt! Looked awesome. Just could not get the tone I wanted out of it. Then it started breaking down all the time.
Utter rubbish.
ironically I sold it and with the money bought a Bugera 6162 head. Faultless, and the tone was so good, that for the money (£200) I bought another! Sold the Black£$hit3 for £420 so actually the bugeras were more than paid for at £200 each. In three years of hard gigging neither let me down

You spoke too soon...the post right after yours...
In the 80's the band I was in had a Fender Twin Reverb as a backup amp. My Ampeg V-4 died at a gig and I had to use the Twin. I know it's close to blasphemy here but I hated that thing.
Haven't played many amps but I tried Line 6 Spider IV once. That one definitely takes the cake for me.
Without a DOUBT, my absolute worst amp of all time was an Acoustic Control 150. Our manager got us a deal with Acoustic to be endorsers, but after a handful of gigs the thing was so bad I rebelled and went back to my Dual Showman.....which is why I have hearing aids.

I feel compelled to say that there are some amazing sounds you can get out of those Silvertones! I have a 1474 that's still my main gigging amp. Admittedly:
a) it has to be the sound you want, because stock they will not really do anything else and
b) mine is no longer approaching stock and
c) the reverb is absolute butt. And not the good kind.
I think the practice amps I inherited from classmates in 1983 and 1984 don't count. A little solid state Global, and a Harmony bass amp with what, an 8"? Those don't count.
The worst *proper* amp? Gonna have to go with the 2006 reissue Ampeg Reverberocket 1x12 that I had briefly recently. Gain channel was five minutes of fun, then "heh now seriously no" and the clean channel had a sort of prickly quality that just drove me nuts... it seemed clear and cut through in a band mix but recorded it was, to my mind, an unusable tone. Shame because the reverb was delicious.
Now a modded silvertone 1474 and a 1979 Princeton Reverb are in a cage match for my heart. (I love both: horses for courses)

MY worst amp was an Acoustic 150 with 6 10” spkrs in a cabinet. Same Speaker Cabinet that Chicago’s Terry Kath used stacked on top of his amp. But the 150 was all solid state. NO tone and it was noisy. Intermittently. Years later a girlfreind that worked in an assembly factory resoldered the connections which were full of cold joints and it finally cleaned up. Even the reverb started to work. But the tone was always awful. But it was loud and in the 70’s loud was good. I had to use a 1960’s Sam Ash red Fuzz Boxx to get a good overdrive sound. After College I got a Fender tube amp, then Mesa Boogies and now playing reissue Ampeg Jet 12’s which are 22 watts like my Deluxe reverb but only 30Lbs. I now have 3 of them. Great tone and easy to dial in what you want. PLus they work great with pedals. Hermida ZenDrive is the **** through that amp. Same pedal Robben Ford uses with his Dumble.
A Peavey Musician solid state head in 1976 and the monstrous cabinet to go with it. Nothing but super loud brittle tone and distortion that sounded like a beehive. Kept it less than a month and traded it for a SF Twin Reverb and thought I had gone to heaven! Before that I sold my Black Face Super Reverb and got a Silver face Dual Showman which was one of the dumbest moves I have ever done. The Showman is the 2nsd worst amp on my list.
Ampeg vt22. 70s model. 100 watts 2/12. Weighed a ton and kept for a month. Awful dull sounds. Felt foolish having it. Ugly too.

I really appreciate your comment, Maps & Guitars! Tone is certainly a very subjective thing, a matter of taste, and many agree with you about the 1474. I know that the amp is considered a desirable vintage amp today by many, for collecting, playing, and modding. Unfortunately, I only remember not getting a sound close to what I wanted with my stock Silvertone, and I had no idea about how to go about modding it in those days. I only remember trying incessantly to get a better tone and that, to my ear, it was a dog - especially the "butt" reverb .
Joking aside, my memory of the amp is 55 years old and I haven't heard one since. I'm glad to hear it is working so well for you! Those old Silvertones seem to have also worked very well for many others including Jack White, so you're in good company. Rock that thing, my friend!

The Blues Jr (I have a III) is a great amp and it has that little "voxy" touch in the upper mids/hi-s. So if you are a Marshall guy and you hate AC30s jingle jangle ...you'll probably have mixed emotions about the BJr.
You have to be careful with the poweramp and find the right sweetspot of saturation...and you can play with low gain preamp tubes like 12AU7s or weaker EL84/BIAS etc for more clean headroom
Besides that perhaps your amp had a problem...Click to expand...
I can't say I've really tried a Vox aside from briefly playing through one at the store but for what it's worth, I always thought the overdrive on my BJr had a British flavour (probably due to the EL84s). Maybe that's just me and my ears. Once I got the PRRI, I realized how much I like that classic Fender sound, so all's well that end's well.

I actually have never had a bad amp. When I was 13 years old, I saved up money from my paper route and bought a Kustom 1 Lead amp and could dial in (close) all the sounds that I needed for the two basement bands that I played in. Then I purchased a Vox Cambridge, Valvetronix AD120, Marshall Haze which were destroyed by a fire but served me well. I now have a Vox AC15 creamback and a Marshall Origin 20c that I absolutely love. All this to say that I’ve never been limited in tone by my gear, only in my ability to play what’s in my head and heart. Keep practicing and growing as a player!

With a high Z adapter and a mic, you can use a Jazz Chorus amp as a sound system ... mic your amp. I've done that with a Champ amp and a Twin.
I bought my first electric guitar because it was a Takamine, and I'd never seen a Takamine electric before. That ran me out of money, so I guess my worst amp ever was the dinky little Johnson I got to go with it. As soon as I could put together the money I bought a Super Champ XD, and the rest is more history.
Does a Zinky Smoke count?
I have an old Blues Jr. that I put in a solid pine Blues Deluxe sized cab with a Cannibus Rex speaker.. That made a world of difference.
Peavey TNT 50 watt bass amp. Even with a EletroVoice replacement speaker it sounded like crap.
Even worse, I sold a Dual Showman Reverb so I could by the TNT.
I've played two Blues Juniors - one was some special edition my brother had, was at a gig so pretty cranked. White Strat. Good. The other Blues Junior was at a music store a couple years ago. Sounded nasty and brittle.
The worst amps I have owned, it's a tie between a Fender Mustang II and a Vox Valvetronix. They both were fine at home at home volumes. The Mustang was impossible to deal with even at band practice; was dang near impossible to dial in the same sound twice without a ton of fiddling. The Valvetronix just didn't cut through at stage volumes, it got real screechy.

Epiphone Valve Jr...... I just never got any sound out of it that was pleasant to me.Click to expand...
I bought the head version, plugged it in at home, and was instantly disappointed. It was dark, muddy, and neither my Strats nor my humbucker guitars sounded good through it. Then I found the 18watt.com website. They had people there that explained the changes needed to open up the sound with a few component replacements. And they had even MORE knowledge about how to convert it into a single-ended little screamer of an amp with some other, more complex changes.
At the time, I was living in a small apartment, post-divorce. I had little money but a fair amount of free time, along with a folding card table for a temporary work space, a small Radio Shack soldering iron, and access to my Company’s Mouser and Digi-Key accounts that enabled me to add my small quantity orders to our lab’s larger orders, so shipping fees were nearly zero for my small number of needed components.
So, using the 18watt.com “Marshallesque” recommendations, and all the caution I could, I dived into small-scale tube amp modification. I had assembled pedals and made modifications to them before, but potentially lethal tube amp voltages were the big leagues, to me. I made the component mods that the 18watt.com community suggested, and dropped a bolshoi Hammond 150ESE output transformer in that dwarfed the small stock OT. All those changes cleaned up the muddy tone and turned it into The Mouse That Roars. I added a gain control for the 12AX7 preamp tube with a pull-boost, wired the volume control to control the signal sent to the EL84 power tube, and wired a NFB circuit on the volume pot on another pull-pot to reduce volume and harshness for apartment use.
I had a Fender 12” speaker in hand that was suitable, and installed it in a LopoLine sealed-back cabinet. It turned out to be a very good match:
After that success, I bought a combo Valve Junior at a steep discount that had been returned to my local GC, and rebuilt that with similar changes, a couple of new ideas I wanted to try, and the Hammond 150ESE OT to leave at my Church. As a combo, it was less successful; the cabinet was poorly matched with the stock speaker, and sounds very boxy. But I’ve plugged that combo’s amp section routinely into a 2x12 Cerwin-Vega cabinet I keep at Church as well, and it sounds glorious.
I learned a lot with those two card-table rebuilds. Unfortunately, my eyesight and my nerves aren’t as good as they were back then. If they were, I’d be building amp kits. Not capable of that anymore.
ANYTHING solid state which tries to pass of clipping as distortion.

I'd say that the slew of little affordable 5W tube amps that were all the rage a few years back a like the Epi Jr., Crate V5, Blackheart, etc. They all sounded like garbage stock and actually required mods just to create a passable sound. Buy a cheap amp and spend twice as much making it sound like something...never really got that concept. One in particular that I had and really sucked was the Peavey Mini Colossal with the Joe Satriani connection. That was a huge disappoinment.

I couldn't find tone in it no matter how I tried. Steel or standard it sucked. That's probably why the guy traded it! The GA-6 on the other hand was a great amp and I'd buy another in a heartbeat. I won't diss all 60's Gibson amps from that era but I'm in no rush to buy another.

I'd say that the slew of little affordable 5W tube amps that were all the rage a few years back a like the Epi Jr., Crate V5, Blackheart, etc. They all sounded like garbage stock and actually required mods just to create a passable sound. Buy a cheap amp and spend twice as much making it sound like something...never really got that concept. One in particular that I had and really sucked was the Peavey Mini Colossal with the Joe Satriani connection. That was a huge disappoinment.Click to expand...
The one semi-exception IMO is the VHT Special 6, at least as a head. It came stock with the beefy OT that the others lacked. It also used a 6V6 instead of an EL84, and you could actually (at least short term) plug in a 6L6 or even EL34. Granted, to get a power tube other than the 6V6 to work optimally did require lifting the hood, but just to sub in a different value of cathode resistor, and it was even pretty easy to just put them on a switch.
...The Special 6 is the only one I'm familiar with (that was just a few hundred bucks) that basically featured both a tweed and BF Champ in a single package, and even made the two modes footswitchable.
Also - even if someone has no intention of dinking around and modding anything, the Special 6 featured an eyelet circuitboard, with the jacks and tube sockets all chassis mounted. That makes maintenance more on par with the older Champs of yesteryear.
I don't use my Special 6 much any longer, but IMO it's way better than the Blackheart Little Giant that I also have (and IMO required mods to really sound at least fair), and since it's a head, it's a lot more usable with various cabs than my '67 Champ is.
Also, although I have no personal experience with it, the VHT Special 6 Ultra was supposedly kind of well embraced by those who wanted more options with overdriven sounds.

Mine blew up in a blaze of smoke and fire before I even got a chance to play it on a gig!
I hated all my earliest amps.
Dean Markley solid state 10-inch = shrill garbage.
Crate 1x15 bass amp = fell apart. The input jack was made of cheap plastic.
Solid state Marshall = more shrill garbage.
Fender Hot Rod = just not my thing, loud + no personality
Finding a great-sounding amp has actually been a lot harder than finding a great-sounding guitar. I made the mistake back in the day of not being willing to spend the $$ to get great sound. I learned my lesson, though, and have taken time to get better gear over the years.
We have a couple inexpensive amps we've kept, either because they had a bit of personality, nice sound and/or were built like a tank:
Peavey Bandit = decent amp, well-built, loud, a backup amp, I'm a Peavey fan
Ampeg 1x15 bass amp = not a lot of volume, but sweet, warm sound; use it for baritone guitar
Bugera 1x12 = decent clean sound; great for pedals, kept as a backup amp

Blackstar S1 50w headClick to expand...
Oh yeah! I forgot that I bought a Blackstar HT Club 40 once! I was shopping for a giggable tube amp. At Guitar Center I played an HT-5 and really liked it, but recognized that I'd need a little more oomph. That was the only Blackstar amp they had in stock, because apparently they were flying out the door.
So I went home and looked up their line, and saw the HT Club 40. Specs-wise the Club 40 should have been exactly what I was looking for. It was (supposedly) a straight-ahead two channel tube amp with Reverb and nothing else. This was refreshing in a time where DSP-driven Vypers, Spyders, Mustangs and the like were everywhere you looked. 40W should be enough horsepower to play the clubs around town, and still not be deafening during practice. It got rave reviews on Harmony Central (both reviews and forums) and many were talking about how Blackstar was out-marshalling Marshall. Blackstar now makes THE Rock, Hard Rock and Metal amp. It's a Modernized JTM-45 and JCM800 rolled into one, they said!
I gave the GC sales guy my number so he'd let me know when the next lot of them came in, but within a couple of days he called to say a lightly used one had just been traded in on something else. I left work early, went and played it, and it sounded great initially over 10 minutes. Before long there was another vulture circling and wanting to get his meat hooks on it, so I bought it on the spot.
I took it home and ran it properly through its paces. Its 'crunch' tone was bluesy and quite good. Going for high/hard gain though was disappointing. There was a spot up the gain knob where it was almost what I wanted, but right after that it would just get creamier and more compressed. Not a bad sound, but more akin to Santana blues than rock, IMHO. It's also the only 'tube' amp that seemed to sound less alive and more cold and sterile the more you turned it up. I say 'tube' because it's actually a hybrid, and i don't recall the sales literature stating anything about that. It took some pedals alright, but didn't like others.
Within the first week it started acting up. Loud intermittent buzzing noises while playing, sound level dropping out randomly, smelling hot. Swapped cables, guitars, outlets. Put a patch cord in the FX loop. No change. Finally it kinda 'shut off' while I was playing it. I turned it off and back on, and it came back, but I ended up returning it.
Too bad.

Pretty much any EL84 powered amp. I’ve owned way too many EL84 powered amps and even very high end ($$$) ones. Pretty much every one has sounded bright (brittle/raspy) and boxy to my ears.

It’s a Quantum. Some say the model is a Terminator 15. My brother had one like it; that was the first amp I used regularly as a beginner. We were glad to get our Crate G10XL combos that Christmas.
The amp that always blew up for me was a Polytone Mini-Brute 1x12". It was "OK" for jazz but didn't have reverb. It tore up or burned up on several occasions. The final event was outdoors playing music around a campfire with some friends... sizzle snap pop... smoke smoke smoke... it had smoke emanating from the input jack... that was the end of the PolyTone... never bought another one.
On the UP side...
Roland came out with a JC-40 version of the JC-120... Next paycheck I am bringing one of those home. Played it for a long test drive at Sam Ash and really dig it. The chorus on the amp is to die for, and I'm not really a chorus using kind of guy. I also have a Roland Cube Street EX, 50 watts, 2x8", 16lbs. Makes a great solo gig amp. Has a microphone channel and a guitar channel with useless COSM modeling. I just use it for clean tone. So far everything I've bought from Roland has been great. All the way back to a 1979 2 rack space Roland SPA-120 stereo power amp. I can't say the same for BOSS. Its basically the same company I suppose but if it says "BOSS" on it I run for the hills, LOL. Go figure...

And they can keep it along with their crappy sounding tubes. Well the EH 6V6gt they make sounds decent.
I'll throw my thumbs up for the Peavey Bandit 65 as well. I recently bought an 80s version for $100 off of Facebook Marketplace and I am very pleased dollar for dollar for the sound that comes out. Nothing fancy or boutiquey, just does what it is supposed to... the "saturation" isn't actually too bad. It does a fair-to-midland job of emulating a tube amp. Turn the volume on your guitar down, the signal cleans up. Could be worse... I don't know if this makes a difference, but the sticker on the back says "Made in USA"... I think Peavey moved to China years ago... Its this model...
Prior to this discovery I have been boycotting Peavey for over 40 years. I had a Peavey Classic 50 tube amp in the early 80s that tore up 4 times... it was a 2x12 cab, first one speaker, then another blew. Then first one tube socket blew out, then the other. I figured after that I'd never buy another Peavey.
2021 rolls around, I see this amp on Facebook Marketplace for $100, I say "oh what the hell" and I have to say I am very impressed. Its pretty heavy and very loud if it needs to be. But it ended a 40+ year personal boycott of everything Peavey.
The Princeton Chorus was pretty useless, IMO. Couldn’t get rid of it fast enough.
My vote for worst amp ever. Kustom 100, and this is NOT a 100 watt amp I don't care what anyone says . Just like the Kustom 200 is not a 200 watt amp. If it was Marshall would never have made it to the market. Hendrix would have had a wall of Kustom 100's....but he didn't.
My radio had more guts !
Never owned either but I have to agree that the Gorillas and Crate in a crate amps were bad in a bad way.
I'm a little surprised at the Blues Jr hate; I have had one since 2007 and it's a favorite. A lot of guys who are better players than me have them and like them as well.
I have owned two Peavey Bandits, over the years, and I don't think that they are bad, just meh. Used one as a slave to fine result.
Probably the worst amps I ever owned were Silvertones; they were the SS models. The first one was an allegedly 5 watter, with a 12" speaker I think, that was mostly inaudible. The other one was a "Twin Twelve" that, bad as it was, I managed to use for five years before I sold it.

I played a "supergroup" gig (though it was really more like a loose jam with a setlist) a few years ago where the other guitarist brought his Princeton Chorus. His tone was sharp, sterile, and overall almost as underwhelming as his playing (that's a story for another time).

I’ve seen pictures of Buddy Guy playing through a Kustom amp like that (I think) on several occasions in the ‘70s. I wonder what he thought of it.
Okay - everybody done complaining about Peaveys and Crates?! I'll just leave this here, and I'll be expecting my prize in the mail...
JK, everybody has an amp they hate. I don't even know if I 'hate' this amp - it literally is what it is. I found it dumpster-diving at Guitar Center, functionally there's absolutely nothing wrong with it. If you expect anything more than a transistor radio sound out of a 'guitar amp' with a 4" speaker...
Worst amp = Behringer - 300 sounds, all lousy.
Best amp = Tweed Pro - one sound, perfect
Well, here's a really crappy sounding Peavey amp .. and I like older Peaveys.
This model belonged to my friend ... used it for keys, so sounded good for that. I couldn't get one good guitar sound out of it.
I did know a Country/Rock guy who did use one and found some OK tones on it, mostly distortion sounds.
Also, too many knobs.
I have a little see-through Dean Markley that I keep on my guitar workbench, just for simple testing. Pretty useless amp otherwise.
It's this thing right here:
The hartke gt60 piggyback.
It sounded great on paper; 4x8 cab, 2 channel amp.
Awful yoke altogether.

That's what you get for buying a REAL "Princeton" pretender.
Try and make the same disparaging comments about any real Princeton from 1955 - 1972 (SF's), even the recent re-issues are awesome.
This is what life is made for if you're a good player, owning the 3 best years of Princetons - 1957, 1960 (brown tolex, wheat cloth) and 1964 (not a reissue).
For me it was the Bassbreaker 15 combo. I've never wanted to rock star an amp off my third floor balcony as much as that one
First run with the bad EFX loop, no footswitch for switching channels, how I missed that at first I dont know, and way too much volume changing between channels.
Add to that Fender not being helpful about replacement parts and I was an unhappy camper. They did offer me a T shirt for any ruffled feathers I may have had. So there's that
Worst?
There are different degrees.
Every small SS fender that comes with affinity squiers. All garbage.
But ones that aren't given away with guitars?
The 10w Marshall SS thing from the late 90s we bought my youngest brother in 2007ish. Awful. It could almost sound as good as a defective DS1 into a crate. Almost. Which reminds me.....
Crate XT & FXT.
My dad started playing guitar after me. His first amp was one of the XTs with a 12. It was akin to a big version of a squier amp. He had that, the digitech multibox with the 2 footswitches and a volume pedal on the side, and an epi LP custom anniversary addition. The LP was great. Everything else... he upgraded later.
Original spider and Spider II. The smallish ones.
Ungood. Didn't see it as a step up from the "cool toy" stuff the POD did at the time.
Teisco ss (checkmate?) Thing. Looked neat. Sounded otherwise.
Crate V?
I played one in Samash that looked like it had been dragged behind a car. Sounded meh. When these came out, stores had them sitting next to Peavey Valvekings. That was bad marketing. They weren't awful, but they weren't great. Notorious reliability issues in reviews weren't as big a put off as bot sounding as good as other things in the price range.
Theres been some mention on here of crate blue voodoo. They had ok cabs, at least.......
My worst amp was my first amp. A Rickenbacker TR7. Thank god I only paid $20 for it at a yard sale. I will say that it made me want tremolo on everything.

I might be wrong but isnt the singer without guitar aussie singer Jimmy Barnes ?
The UK retailer gear4Music sells rebadged Belcat amps under their own brand, SubZero. Their 20 Watt combo is a low rent, unsafe ripoff of the Fender Blues Junior. Unsafe how?, try no internal fuses, overly long screws near/touching high voltage parts. They've also been revealed as using 'whatever is on the shelf' including reclaimed parts and power transformers in place of output transformers. Not all use the dodgy transformers, but the lack of fusing is a worry.
Their 50 Watt head had a production phase that saw in excess of 50% warranty returns. Incorrect value resistors causing redplate and transformer burn.
The worst of all though is the 'Tube-5' I bought one ( the head model ), knowing it'd be shyte, for the cabinet and chassis, hoping the transformers would be specced correctly ( they sort of are ). Poorly assembled with evidence of reclaimed components, capacitors from switched mode supplies mainly. Bare wire where the insulation has been sloughed from the transformer wiring. Cheap pots and sockets. The output transformer is useable though.
It isn't even an all valve ( signal wise ) amp to begin with. I have no qualms with op-amps. None at all. Wonderful little devices, when implemented correctly. Quite what the op-amp in this bag of mashings is doing, I have yet to fully establish. Clean, it sounds like a cheap transistor amp of the type that gives transistor amps a bad name. Dawsons Music had the same amp under their 'Redwood' brand, and dumped it as quickly as they could. No matter what cab I put it through, its true character issued forth. Nasal, honky, weak, insipid cardboard sounds. Engage the 'drive' via the front panel push button, and things go from bad to worse. Ibanez make a 5 Watt valve amp with built in Tube Screamer capabilities, and quite good it sounds too. Perhaps Belcat got their inspiration from that, or from the the 'Overdrive' circuits in their way better tweed covered solid state amps, and thought it'd be a good idea to add it in. It wasn't. It really wasn't. Narrow, constricted, boxy, buzzy, mosquito sounds. Even the store demo on Youtube sounds like mildly warmed over ocelot cak.If that was your first and only experience of valve amps, you'd wonder what the fuss was about. Not just bad, fractally bad.
The 1x10" cabinets in the same blue finish are very good value though.
My Hotone Purple Wind sounds better in every way possible. It sounds more valve than this execrable insult to glowing glass could ever dream of, as it curls up, foetal position, sobbing about its fate. My Blackstar Fly 3, even through its own single speaker, without the extension, blows it away in terms of bass, mids, treble, soundstage, depth and tone.
Truly, the Belcat Tube-5H is a cold dung sandwich minus the bread.
The output transformer is the same as is used on many Sino 5 Watt amps, so that's OK. The power transformer, after I heatshrinksulate the leads for safety, is useable. The cabinet is acceptable, even if the 'tolicks' <sp deliberate > is parting ways in places, and the chassis is quite good. I see a 6N2P powering a 6P1P in its future, when I locate a few circular tuits and finish the build(s) I've got going currently.

Correct! It's his band Cold Chisel, they would do shows as The Barking Spiders in their early days if they didn't want to draw a crowd so they could test new material, play old covers etc. A few decades later after a long hiatus, they decided to reform for a one off show with very little fanfare, so it was advertised as the Barking Spiders, not to throw people off the scent (they even called themselves by that name on a live album years ago, so everyone knows exactly who they are these days), more I think to send a message that the show was a definite one off, rather than fire up the Cold Chisel juggernaut and all the media and hoopla that that entails. These days they still do reunite for tours as Cold Chisel on a semi regular basis, their stuff is timeless.

Any thoughts on the worst amps you've ever played?Click to expand...
I believe that an amplifier may or may not be a proper fit for your intended application. However, if it doesn't fit well, it doesn't mean it's bad for all applications. There was quite a learning curve for me to approximate the SRV distorted-clean tone from my '68 Bassman AB165 (modified). What's more strange is that after learning how with my equipment, I couldn't tell anyone exactly how to do it on your particular rig. It's dependent on the amp you have, as well as your specific guitar, and the specific effects you use. Cheers!
A friend of mine used to have a little transistor amp called a "Tube Stack". Perfect name, because it didn't have tubes and it wasn't a stack.The sound was on par with the name.
Marshall Valvestate. Because it wasn't cheap back in the day, and broke down every ten minutes. Plus, it wears the "Marshall" logo and has the gimmicky valve just to appeal to gullible teens who had no internet to tell 'em the difference between a jcm800 and a ****ty pseudo Marshall.

I bought the head version, plugged it in at home, and was instantly disappointed. It was dark, muddy, and neither my Strats nor my humbucker guitars sounded good through it. Then I found the 18watt.com website. They had people there that explained the changes needed to open up the sound with a few component replacements. And they had even MORE knowledge about how to convert it into a single-ended little screamer of an amp with some other, more complex changes.
At the time, I was living in a small apartment, post-divorce. I had little money but a fair amount of free time, along with a folding card table for a temporary work space, a small Radio Shack soldering iron, and access to my Company’s Mouser and Digi-Key accounts that enabled me to add my small quantity orders to our lab’s larger orders, so shipping fees were nearly zero for my small number of needed components.
So, using the 18watt.com “Marshallesque” recommendations, and all the caution I could, I dived into small-scale tube amp modification. I had assembled pedals and made modifications to them before, but potentially lethal tube amp voltages were the big leagues, to me. I made the component mods that the 18watt.com community suggested, and dropped a bolshoi Hammond 150ESE output transformer in that dwarfed the small stock OT. All those changes cleaned up the muddy tone and turned it into The Mouse That Roars. I added a gain control for the 12AX7 preamp tube with a pull-boost, wired the volume control to control the signal sent to the EL84 power tube, and wired a NFB circuit on the volume pot on another pull-pot to reduce volume and harshness for apartment use.
I had a Fender 12” speaker in hand that was suitable, and installed it in a LopoLine sealed-back cabinet. It turned out to be a very good match:
View attachment 808421
After that success, I bought a combo Valve Junior at a steep discount that had been returned to my local GC, and rebuilt that with similar changes, a couple of new ideas I wanted to try, and the Hammond 150ESE OT to leave at my Church. As a combo, it was less successful; the cabinet was poorly matched with the stock speaker, and sounds very boxy. But I’ve plugged that combo’s amp section routinely into a 2x12 Cerwin-Vega cabinet I keep at Church as well, and it sounds glorious.
I learned a lot with those two card-table rebuilds. Unfortunately, my eyesight and my nerves aren’t as good as they were back then. If they were, I’d be building amp kits. Not capable of that anymore. Click to expand...
Sorry, late edit. The OTs I used are Hammond 125ESE. I apologize for the confusion and misinformation.

This one could be the winner just because it says Esteban on it.
Yamaha YTA-95..horror 1970s transistor tones. I remember buying a EHX LPB boost pedal to try and get that amp to sound mean, but no joy. It did however have built-in wah wah which was useful for one song..Pictures of Matchstick Men by Status Quo. I think it was pretty much a 95w hifi amp in 2x12 combo. I got rid of it and bought a Marshall 50w 2x12 combo which sounded great but the power transformer went up in smoke at a gig and nearly choked everyone with the fumes ;-)
https://reverb.com/au/item/12700205-yamaha-yta-95
A Yamaha THR about 5 years ago. Don't remember the exact model, but it was a combo in a metal enclosure, with a couple of little 3" or 4" speakers and put out about 10 watts. It had a tiny sound with no depth or dimension. Sounded thin and sterile with no girth or bass. Gave it away for free to a friend. He tried to sell it at a swapmeet and only got 10 bucks for it.

We've covered this a half-dozen times, but here are mine again. Both were in the '90s.
1. The smallest Crate practice amp that was built like a wooden crate. Got it in a trade. It smoked and died with a noise like a bug being strangled. It smoked, one day, and went into the trash.
2. One of those little Gorilla practice amps. Paid $20 for it. The tone could be varied between nasty and the sound of spoons in a garbage disposal. Smoked and trashed.Click to expand...
Yeah, I remember those little Gorilla amps in the 80s an 90s. They sucked rocks, terrible sound.
I had 2 amps that really sucked. The first was a Vox modeling amp, forgot the name. Only reason I got it was because someone owed me money & couldn't pay, so he gave me the amp.
The other crapamp I had was a Mesa/Boogie; the black one with the EL84s. Basically firewood.
The worst expensive amp I ever owned was the '65 Twin Reverb re-issue. Just sounded blah, and turned me off to any re-issues, guitar OR amp.

It was a small natural wood cab with a small speaker, kind of like a Pignose.
I bought one used in 1982 for $35 from a co-worker; my first guitar and amp had been stolen in 1980 ( College), so the Dwarf was at least something to use with my 2nd guitar...
Wish I still had it!

Personally, the worst I ever played was a second generation/version of a Blues Junior. Played it for 10 years because I absolutely had to have a tube amp and couldn’t afford anything else at the time (also I didn’t know about affordable non-Fender/solid state options). It always sounded boxy and muddy overdriven (pedal or amp) and thin and sterile clean. Eventually, I bought a Peavey Bandit as a backup but both I and my bandmates thought it sounded better than the Blues Jr. The Blues Jr became the backup to the Bandit instead and I ended up selling it after I got a good deal on a PRRI.
That’s just my opinion, I know the Blues Jr gets a lot of love. I played a Blues Jr III or IV as a backline amp at a gig a few years later and I thought it sounded better than the one I had, but not enough to wish I owned one again.
I’ve played a few amps in store or at jams that had so many controls that I didn’t know how to make it make a good sound. Can’t remember what the brand/model names of those ones, though.Click to expand...
Ive had 4 or 5 blues/pro juniors. Got them used, good shape but pretty good deals. Tried my best to like them but just never did. Everyone ended up having weird noise issues after a while and can’t imagine trusting one to gig with.
I see a lot of *ahem* “love” for the Line 6 Spider. I had one, a 1x12 combo, and while I admit it sounded horrible (let’s not get into how I convinced myself to buy it), it had one feature that redeemed it: a friend liked it enough to take the Line 6, and $300 CDN, in exchange for a Delta Blues 2x10. For that reason, I have a fondness for the Line 6.

The worst amp I've ever owned was a Heathkit 2x12 SS combo I found on the curb on trash day. I grabbed it thinking it may have some decent speakers in it. Turned out the no-name speakers were blown, but the amp portion worked fine.
I found some Realistic 12" speakers at a hamfest for $5 each and stuck 'em in there. The amp was two channels (not switchable) and had volume and tone controls and a tremolo that was terrible. I replaced the torn-up grill cloth and painted a name badge on the front: Barking Spider. This was 15 years before Line 6 came out with their Spider amp. Trendsetting is a thankless job
A few years later a pal of mine named Rick said he loved the lo-fi tone of the thing, so I gave it to him. If you know a guy named Rick who also goes by the nickname 'Guido' and plays through a Heathkit Barking Spider amp, that's the one!Click to expand...

Were those the ones with aluminum domes like JBLs? We used to use those in the 70s when we blew our Fender and Peavey speakers. Made by Pyle, I heard. Good speakers.

A Yamaha THR about 5 years ago. Don't remember the exact model, but it was a combo in a metal enclosure, with a couple of little 3" or 4" speakers and put out about 10 watts. It had a tiny sound with no depth or dimension. Sounded thin and sterile with no girth or bass. Gave it away for free to a friend. He tried to sell it at a swapmeet and only got 10 bucks for it.Click to expand...
I would change the Peavey for the THR10 any day of the week!!
It was called „Maine“. Late 70ies. It just died.

Yep! Labeled 'Realistic Musical Instrument Speaker'.
Fender Frontman 212R. Cleans were okay but it didn't never sound as full as I wanted. Distortion was the worst ever! Thank god to pedals. Changed to Marshall VM tube amp and still have it after 10 years. Not going to sell it ever. Going to buy new Fender amp this year to get better twangy sound with my tele. With Marshall it sounds good but not so tele'ish as I want it to sound.
acoustic and vocal mix
thoughts on reverb treatment specifically.. and any other constructive feedback much appreciated.
That reverb has too much high end frequency in it.
Just my two cents but sometimes a great track
with the wrong reverb setting is like digging your own grave......
you'll never be able to dig yourself out of that hole
until you fix it.
It sounds like a verb for a small club performance.
Ok thanks for that. I can't hear it. Dang my bad hearing. Makes this stuff very challenging. I have no high freq hearing anymore.
this is the sort of ballpark i'm wanting to get into with the ambiance

Cat Power is great.
I think she records and produces her own albums
sometimes.
The vocals are thick and harmonized making it hard to tell
what was being reverb saturated.
They might have used some pre delay to get those verbs
to sit well in the track.
It is hard to distinguish the background vocals verb from
the main vocal verb. Like they were meeting somewhere
in the ambient middle!
The Cat Power reverb sounds very much like a Hall Plate style reverb. Something akin to an EMT 140. Definitely some pre-delay and eq'ing of the reverb. I also suspect that the reverb send is up higher than expected to saturate the signal and then the reverb send level is brought down a bit. I'm betting its the same reverb for lead and BGVs, just slightly different settings.
When there are a lot of backing vocals, I will use something like Eventide's Black Hole for that more distant choir effect and the EMT 140 on the lead vocal. It blends well but creates a realistic from to back depth.
Studio has it right. There's too much high end on your reverb. If your reverb plugin has eq on it, try taking some of that high end off. Sounds like a plate setting. If it doesn't have EQ, then place an EQ plugin following the reverb on the same aux channel, and roll off some of the low end as well as the highs. Make it more mid focused.
I don't hear much reverb at all and come away thinking that song needs more. I listen at the end of a phrase/ last word and hear nuttin. ? Other than that it's great!

i'm in the same boat. i can't hardly hear much reverb at all. i even put my hearing aids in (hate these things) in hopes of hearing what it is that studio and instituteofnoise are talking about and it escapes me. i have no doubt these gentlemen know what they are talking about, it simply eludes me. i guess i better not give up my day job.
Yes it wasn't so much the amount of reverb. It was very conservative, but rather the timbre of it. It's a very easy fix, if that's what you're after.

I'm going to try to figure out how to do what you suggested. I'm a bit of a caveman though and get fuzzy with stuff...like aux channel? I just have 2 tracks for this recording and an eq, comp and reverb applied...i don't understand what you said... But I will hit up the reaper forum. Thank you

Leave your recorded tracks as is except mute/bypass the reverb on those channels.
Now create an auxillary channel which we'll say the input to it is Bus 1-2. Output should be probably your master buss output channel in this case.
Put your reverb plugin on that and set the level for now to unity or 0.
Now on your recorded channels you want to put a send on a slot on that channel and send it to Bus 1-2.
Now you can raise the level of that send to where you are hearing the amount of reverb desired (think wet/dry where wet is the reverb channel and the recorded audio is the dry. Blend till you're happy).
Now if you wanted to EQ the reverb, just add an EQ plugin after the Reverb plugin on the aux channel. try hi-pass around 1khz and low-pass around 6k to start. If it's taking too much tone out just adjust the pass filters a bit wider to bring back in some of it.
If you want an image of this let me know and I'll post a few for you.
Aux channels and bussing are techniques I have avoided so far. I guess I need to grow up and learn how to do it right.

Naw it's a cinch really. Don't avoid making it easier for yourself!
This took more time to upload than to create this example... haha! granted it's Pro Tools and you have Reaper but same principal applies. Guitar and Vocal channel go to master output buss and each of these has their own EQ and Comp on it. Then each track sends to the reverb aux channel on bus 3-4. You can also pan where you want the reverb to fall, which leaves you way more options. Here the guitar is slight left and the vocal is up the middle. Here's also the reverb EQ added. The EMT140 has EQ within it, but for example I've set it up like this to show you. This EQ setting on the Reverb I believe is the classic Abbey Road curve setting. Make more sense now?
I'm not uet 100% on how this translates to reaper but I will know before the weekens is over. Thank you @InstituteOfNoise
found this video that shows how to set up aux channels and send to them. looks easy !
i'm thinking the changes are subtle but i have set up the aux channel with my reverb and 2 EQs (one on either side of the verb) cutting all but mid frequencies, and routed the vocal and guitar through the aux track.
https://soundclick.com/r/s8b7hu
i also put new batteries in my hearing aids and tried very hard to hear what i'm doing instead of flying purely on visual/instruments.
The soundclick version sounds way different, much more transparent than the SoundCloud version. Must be the way the different platforms process your file. Overall, I like this sound better. But now I can hear what studio was saying. The high frequency reverberations are somewhat distracting.
Might be interesting to upload the original to soundclick and see if it sounds better on that platform.
I did make some changes as recommended so it coukd just be a better sounding .wav
Tele brightness when unplugged
I play my electric guitars unplugged all the time. Perfect for keeping it quiet when kids are asleep.
I sort of bought into the notion that tonewoods in electrics don't matter and it is primarily the pickups.
My recently built tele with maple top and ashtray bridge is very bright when amped and unplugged. So what's making most of the brightness when unplugged? The ashtray bridge or the maple?
What's the bridge made out of? Steel? Brass? The Fender ones are thin and don't always lie flat. That could be causing it.
How thick is the maple? What's underneath the maple cap? Is it chambered at all?
Sent from my LG-H830 using Tapatalk
I would say it's mostly the bridge.
My 3 basically similar Teles all have standard Fender 3 saddle ashtray bridges with 3 brass saddles - I've always felt that bridge to be a key part of the Tele chemistry.
But the sparkliest of the 3 acoustically is the lightest by about 8oz, and is the only one with a swamp ash one piece body. Compared with the other two alder bodied guitars (actually one may be basswood, not sure) it's like when you put new strings on an acoustic.
I'm pleased because sparkly was what I was hoping for (and the Bareknuckle Country Boy pickups were planned to have the same clean sound), but I wouldn't build an argument on my small sample though. I'm very much a believer in the individuality of each guitar, the total package of materials, hardware, strings, fit and finish, and wouldn't doubt the experience of others. I'm very happy with the variety of acoustic and electric sounds my 3 give me.

The wood of a solidbody guitar determines how the strings will vibrate ... the pickups transduce those vibrations. Here's how you simply prove this assertion: Play a few phrases on your guitar ... unplugged. Now, press the headstock of the guitar against a sheetrock wall. Play some more ... is it louder? Can you hear the guitar resonating from the wall? The vibrations of the strings are vibrating the body and neck of the guitar ... enough to transfer those vibrations to the wall and vibrate the sheetrock. So, it's pretty clear that the wood is vibrating like crazy ... if these vibrations from the wood are enough to activate the wall, you can imagine that the vibrating wood is affecting the strings ... they are connected directly to the wood. Pick sets strings in motion ... they transmit vibrations to the wood, which is connected to the strings, so those vibrations interact with the already moving strings ... sympathetic vibrations. How can anyone doubt that wood affects the sound of a solidbody? The particular vibrations of the strings is what the pick-ups are transducing.
I would say that the guitars brightness is what makes it sound bright. No magic there me thinks...........

That analogy always sounds sooo obvious and convincing. Problem is ... it's not.
See Manfred Zollner's strat-and-box experiment in "The Physics of E-Guitars: Vibration – Voltage – Sound wave - Timbre" ...
https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/88a7/c4bedb89fdfda7ed01f11f77d9e14939c004.pdf
Zollner compared the amplitude-frequency spectra of microphone recordings to those recorded directly from the pickups, when a solid body electric guitar was in contact with a resonant box and when it wasn't - see below.
You can see the increased resonance acoustically in the microphone ('airborne sound') recordings - what you would hear acoustically - when in contact with the box. But the frequency spectra from the direct pickup output - what you would hear amplified - was unaffected.
To explain ... the bottom two graphs each show two curves - the spectra from the microphone recordings ('airborne sound') for the neck or body touching the resonant box or not touching it; the two touching/not-touching curves differ, consistent with the difference you would hear (ie more acoustic resonance when touching). The top two graphs are the frequency spectra from the pickup recordings for the touching/not-touching conditions - they are essentially the same (some so close you cannot see two curves), ie no real difference.
The conclusion from that experiment is thus that the resonance of the wood to which a solid body electric is attached makes a considerable heard difference to its acoustic resonant tone, but little or no difference to the amplified tone from its pickups.

I agree when unplugged I can feel the wood of the body vibrating against my recently acquired grandpa belly.
the real reason that the wood makes a difference in the guitars sustain and tonality are the wood pixies. each wood is mentored by different wood pixies, they impart to their wood the cosmic nature of their specific vibrations.
unfortunately pixies are tricksters so they play the trick of having the wood of your guitar go from clear and bell like to the sorry fwap-fwap-fwap of cheap wet disintegrating particle board. but hey they love a good joke.
It does seem that the pups are the main factor in tone and I know I should really only play plugged in. However a resonant guitar is much nicer for quiet unplugged noodling.
I have one Tele that is brighter than the others. It doesn't matter which neck or bridge I put on that body, or which pickups. It always has a brighter, steelier sound than the others. And it's wired the same as my others. What else could it be besides the body? BTW, it's a heavy pine body from a CV 50s Tele. I'm only reporting my own experience.
I have a couple of tele's with the same bridge but one is much brighter than the other.
I play them unplugged daily when noodling. The tele with super jumbo frets and rosewood board is brighter than the maple neck medium fret guitar. At a guess I would say it's due to the frets.

The conclusion to one experiment by one guy who may or may not have a preexisting bias, is not sufficient to convince me. Perhaps his methods were faulty. Years of acoustic tones corroborating the amplified sounds of a solidbody challenge the outcome of this experiment. They haven't been able to replicate cold fusion, either.
Look at what you wrote ... "Little or no difference." Who said BIG difference? Is it little or is it none? Because "little" is a little vague. Where is the experiment that establishes that 'little" is too little for most people to discern ... which leaves all of us that have better hearing than most, which may very well be a lot of musicians, who have more highly trained attention to subtle details of sound and music? Meh.

I love data. I've always wanted to do this with different tonewoods to see how the frequency response changes (not what you "hear", which is subjective). I'm sure somebody's done it, but it would be cool to test to see if the woods actually do make a difference using cold, hard data.
Why do two guitars with the same design and pickups sound different? Same hardware, same scale.
Must be the materials. We'll leave "tone in the fingers" for another day.
Some of the vibrational energy in the strings goes into the neck and body, some remains in the strings. You hear it all when unplugged, but only the string vibrations through the amp.
And you can't separate the effect of the various components. They are mechanically coupled and you always hear the combination.

So what's making most of the brightness when unplugged?Click to expand...
The bridge plate, saddles, body wood, string ferrules, nut, tuners, string trees, neck wood, frets, strings, truss rod, pickguard, control plate, and wood glue.
That "proof" disproving the first premise is so wrong.
The premise is not that touching the wall changes the guitar, it's that the vibrating guitar changes the wall.
About all touching the wall (or a box) will do is maybe result in quicker decay, less sustain as the energy bleeds off into the object.
The original premise was to show that the body and neck of the guitar were vibrating, and that those vibrations affect the strings just like they affect the wall.
The disproving proof has cause and effect backwards.
You want a real experiment? Get the wall or box vibrating that you're touching the guitar up against and then see how it sounds. Getting the right vibrations into the wood could result in additional harmonics coming off the strings, or nasty feedback... Ask the Beatles how they recorded the intro to I Feel Fine.
In fact I think I just invented a new guitar gizmo - one that vibrates the guitar to enhance the notes or chords you're playing.

Does it have a bigger neck angle than the others?
Pickups are the biggest factor in plugged in sound.
Saddles and bridge design are probably biggest factor in unplugged sound and sustain. Some of this comes through the amp, to a lesser degree than unplugged.
Wood factors into the unplugged sound. Some of this comes through the amp, though to even a lesser degree than the saddles/bridge. Honestly, I think it's very subtle by the time it's coming out of the amp.
Your setup has a big effect on acoustic sound, lesser on plugged in sound.
Then you have tuner design, fret material, as minute factors.
Probably the neck joint contact, and bridge contact has some effect on the acoustic resonance, and sustain.
It all adds up and you end up with each guitar having it's own sound, even when made with identical parts.
At the end of the day, you build or buy a guitar, and hope that the stars were aligned and it all works together to make a good instrument.
I've made several parts teles/strats, and some are far more resonant than others. But I love them all. And even the ones that aren't all that resonant when played acoustically can still sounds great when plugged in if they have good setup and pickups. Conversely, the resonant ones don't sound great when plugged in if they have bad pickups.
It's kind of a crap shoot, so OP should be happy his guitar sounds pleasing to him.

Hmmm, not that I can tell, but that's a good question. It's flat in the pocket with no shim of any kind - like the others. I think I would need to measure it though, to know for sure.
If you want to test if the body vibrations of a guitar effects the strings try this:
Take your guitar and hold it verically by the neck. Then take a hammer and hit the body quite hard; are the strings vibrating?
To make this scientiffically right do it many times with different guitars.
Do you feel better now?
Do the pickups sound the same before and after? You can try hitting the pickups too.
Do you regret doing this intead of just enjoying your great sounding guitars?

Probably the Maple. Anyone who's had a Gibson L6S all maple can attest to the wood issue. I've had 3 over the years. The first was all maple including the fretboard. Birdseye too! I tried a ton of pickups/pots/caps but nothing changed the bright sterile no sustain tone that inhabited that guitar. HB's, P90' s, Fender SC's, P94's, etc. I love the feel of those L6S's, tried two more over the years, one had a rosewood board. No change.
A solid body guitar has acoustic properties like all matter so maybe your Telecaster is acoustically bright unplugged. The plugged in electric sound is being produced by a completely different set of physical principals, electromagnetic induction.
Electric players talk about the string vibrating the body which sends overtones back into the string affecting the sound and the way the string breaks the magnetic field of the pickups. I have never heard someone say this about their acoustic guitar. The string vibrations pass into the body, the wood vibrates, exciting air molecules, producing sound. The end. I've heard no one postulate their acoustic guitar sends vibrations back into the string making the string sound different. Just a thought.

I'm more concerned about how my guitars sound when plugged into an amp. Acoustic guitars ...Now that's a different subject.
Is this forum for crusty old geezers?
Perhaps it has been myopic of me to imagine that all the disembodied entities behind the posts are of similar characteristics to myself.
Do telecasters hold a particular sway over the liver-spotted boomers - the last remnant of a guard whose rearing was saturated in a music scene that the less-aged can only wistfully imagine?
Is there any room for the telecaster in today's stream-lined, instant gratification-obsessed, disposable, sterile commercial jingle-like music scene? Will time swallow up the cultural identity of a generation of yore, and compress it into bitesized ad-campaigns to compensate for the following's lack of?
What shall become of the telecaster?!
Pray tell, keepers of history!
Even a liver-spotted boomer such as myself can see the Tele is alive and well with today’s musical youth. Even a casual perusal in Google will bear that out.
The Telecaster will out-live me.
Fear not ! We geezers shall bequeath our Tele's to the unwashed masses of youth, that they shall seek the truth !
I was feeling kind of youthful and vital this morning, working from 6AM straight through till almost 11AM. Took my first break of the day and came here for some refreshing Tele conversations. First thread I opened was this.
Now, I feel old and in the way at 63. Worse yet, I own 5 Fender Teles. I am a poster child for the liver spotted Tele owner.
I do think 50 years from now the Tele will still be popular... and, I won't be.
i was a lot younger when i joined this forum than i am now
Liver Spot Boomers.

You pose two distinct questions...."Is this forum for crusty old geezers"....and "What shall become of the Telecaster"? Yes, this forum has a lot of (us) old geezers, but it also has a lot of "geezers-in-waiting", and guys (and hopefully gals) who want to mine the experiences and knowledge those geezers possess. I don't pretend to have all the answers, but maybe I have a snippet or two I can share....and you can listen or not. But many of the old guys here are not just "old soldiers" sitting around in the nursing home reliving past glories....they're still out there in the trenches, fighting battles, and devising new strategies to do their jobs. I, for one, welcome fresh blood and viewpoints....exposure to new artists and even products, although I pretty much have all the tools I need to accomplish my objectives....but you never know, right?
As to what shall become of the Telecaster?....good question. It has remained unchanged for nearly seventy years, (not a long time in the scheme of things) and until some radical shift in musical thinking occurs, I think it will remain with us in one form or another. Obviously, someone in the 1600's, 1700's or 1800's couldn't envision electric and electronic instruments like we have, but is music really that different from their day? It's still basically a twelve tone scale, arranged in patterns pleasing to contemporary ears, for the purpose of touching people's emotions. And as long as someone is capable of picking up a Tele and doing that, it should still be around.....at least I hope it will.

It took me a long time to finally warm up to the telecaster. I think it is a sign of musical maturity. Eventually the next generation will learn to behold the power of the tele ... and the next generation after that ... and the next ...
I'm still living the generation X thing and my liver spots have socks which are older than you....

That is lyrically satirical...made my frickin day...thanks!
My theory behind old guys and teles is that we lose a lot of our top-end hearing as we get older. We're losing the ability to hear treble frequency so we gravitate to the trebliest guitar ever.
You have to remember, these liver spotted boomers were kids in the 50s and some saw the original electric guitars actually being used by cowboy bands and early rockers. It kind of stamps a nostalgia aura in our brains. That said, I'm originally from the Midwest and those early musical encounters my parents dragged me to, also know as the "local dance" or fairground "artists", were memorable. I do remember however that mostly thick Gibson's, L models, were the order of the day in most bands. The whole Fender Telecaster emergence kind of took place in California, then Texas and then deep Southern States. Some of it spread to Chicago.
By the mid 50s when Les Paul ruled and Chuck Berry came along. Gibson had the focus with the Les Paul and 335 models. Then the Beatles hit with a variety of Gretsch guitars. This is the era when the definitions of guitar tone we know today took place. Prior to this time most guitars were recorded clean. Eric Clapton, friend of the Beatles brought forward, in this order, the exposure of the average kid to various guitar models i.e. Telecaster, Les Paul, SG, 335. This was long before his Fender Strat days. Jimi Hendrix brought forward the Strat, which was marginally popular after the Beatles had used one on a record and the British invasion bands also drove some marginal Strat popularity. These bands also used Epiphone, Mossrite, Baldwin and a host of other now obscure models. BB king settled in on the the 335.
The tele had a brief return to popularity when George Harrison used one on the Beatles last couple of albums.
I would say for almost 30 years the Strat however, was the guitar of choice on most rock, pop, 80s, 90s music. It totally dominated the landscape and coming in second was the Les Paul in Southern Rock and Metal (root of metal sound was Black Sabbath and Deep Purple). So overall if you played Rock, you played either an LP or a Strat.
When Waylon Jennings emerged with the Outlaws with his white leatherbound tele in the 70s, it brought forward the tele again. Then Merle Haggard and a host of players in a direct line to today. During the early 60s the tele also continued as a Western Swing and Country guitar but the modern country tele sound emerged through later guys like Brent Mason and his earlier influencers in the 70s, host of Nashville old skill players. This is the country sound today that so many players try to learn i.e. chickn pickn. The "Hot Rod Lincoln" sound was an early root of what later emerged. There is a host of tele players going back to Jimmy Bryant who kept the Tele alive and popular but it's usage went up and down. Jimmy actually played Mossrite later in his career.
I find the tele, pure, simple, base guitar. Is there a place for it in todays world? If you find a mellow place with a fine selection of food and drink. You will likely find a tele. There's your history.
I guess I now qualify as a geezer; not sure about the crusty part yet, but I'll start to work on it!

Trends I've watched in guitar models for the younger crowds gigging or starting to break out:
Pervasive Telecasters, Jazzmasters, and PRS.
Shrinking appearances of Strats and SGs except for box store Strat-like beginner guitars.
About flat with Les Paul models.
The guitar factories seem to offer and make a lot of those long-spiky-horned Strat-like-devices for "deathly" metal that must be selling.
A lot of Telecaster and PRS sightings on television shows with most of the band members back in the shadows except for the star out front. Including the bands playing 'reality shows' for singers.

just too many years in the industry ,I've seen it all, even when Gene Simons came on stage at 63 wearing leater studded underwear and platform shoes ,spewing blood ,and eating fire ....and people paid 100.00 a ticket to see this, when i mentioned it to the lighting guy I was working with he just about Shrit his Shrots!!!
It's a funny thing... I am now around 64 or so (not good at math) and when I was a kid NOBODY wanted a Telecaster. It was a guitar for country music, and out in Oakland CA none of us were interested. Nobody cool played on one - though I found out later that lots of cool guys had played on them without me ever seeing the pictures. I got my first Tele in '83, because I needed to trade a Super Reverb for something portable, and it matched my Strat and I had noticed Keith R playing one. Nobody I knew had a Tele. Now every time I turn around I see a Telecaster.
Of course this place is full of geezers, who else can sit around posting all day? Everyone else has jobs.
I'm inclined to think I gravitated to the Tele (about 10 years ago) after using a Gretsch, Les Paul and Strat for the 40 years prior to that for the same reason as mentioned earlier. It's the only thing more high pitched than my tinnitus, which seems to be in the frequency range of a crash cymbal for some odd reason.

Durn hipsters, with their Teles!
I'm still relatively young, a little shy of 40, and have no intention of being a geezer. Many of you are my daily inspiration for the latter!
Guitar is a slowly becoming a thing of the past ... oh well ...
31 year old checking in. My first guitar was a Squier tele, it currently belongs to a talented guitar student I've worked with for years now.
He loves it and I expect players like him will continue to carry the torch. I keep it set up and share the techniques that are unique to this model and Fenders in particular.
Who says the internet is about wasting time?!!?
I started out in surf guitar. Nothing but a strat, Mosrite or perhaps a Jaquar existed in my world for years.
And then Jimi came along.
Weren't those mopheads playing strats too?
hey Silverman
to your question 1, yes and no, as any forum is, it just happens, that (this IMHO) the realization that you'll be able to play most of the music with a simple tool comes at an older age instead of being constricted by gimmicks and toys, we have older and younger members here, most of the older members have a HUGE knowledge all together, amps, telecasters, guitars, music theory and on... i don't think we miss expertise in any of those fields around here ( thanks guys  ).
About crusty... weeeeeeelllllll  ... "with a short fuse" might be the right one ... is this forum a tad raw ? yes it is, and it's one of the things i love the most, a-la " cut the crap, think about what you're doing " is an attitude that i personally like a lot because ... well .. i was built that way, when i joined i felt at home almost right away, i once read on another forum .. "on tdpri you need to have a thick skin" well i agree, but everyone is treated with respect, the few times that something goes out of bounds it'll be short lived, there's no place for that here.
About the second question, we "old ones" ( debatable .. it's how you feel inside that counts ) got all our teles, fender has recently changed it's line and the AVRI is no more, fender is looking into the newer and younger generations, what will happen to the telecaster ? besides the innovations brought to the new american original series, i don't see very much happening shortly, i think fender has really added the means and tools to make the tele a bit "easiear" playable, bigger frets, 9,5 radius, compensated saddles... did i forget something ?
It's really hard to "upgrade" something which strong side is simplicity, and where you need to work your a$$ off onto, i like my teles, and wouldn't change them for anything right now, they slap you hard in the face if you're not 100 % on it .. and i love that.
& thanks to nojazzhere for the excellent post !

There are plenty of Tele's in today's music. The real problem is is that there isn't a lot of guitar in today's music.
yep...now get outta my yard!..
Fender should offer Liver Spot as a finish on an American Standard.
Anyone gonna post any picks of their favourite liver spots?
Well Well we have 35 year old fancy word Smith er of intellectual mind,where on earth does a 35 year old learn this stuff ,Shouldnt you have your face buried in your phone.
Who you callin liver spotted old Geezer you young whippersnapper you!
Tele is forever Im sure.
The Telecaster has been there from the beginning and I see more of them on stages today than ever, so I don't think there is much to fear about its demise.
When the issue of age comes up, which it inevitably does, I resort to my favorite saying:
'Old age and treachery will overcome youth and skill'
As a reference ... in somewhat of a parallel universe ... I play vintage 'Tele's, as well as modern-day incarnations, such as the Parker P-36 ... HOWEVER ... (and, this is that "parallel universe" thing) ... I am a horn (upper-brass) player. My go-to horns are vintage (late 1940s and early 1950s) Martin Committee's, as popularized by Miles Davis and Chris Botti.
Check them out on the internet -- eBay, Google, etc. I've had a couple dozen, or-so, over the years. Now, "down" to about 1/2-dozen.
Check out my age, here.

Just like dirty old men, there are dirty old men and young lads waiting to become dirty old men. There are "crusty old geezers" and those waiting to become crusty old geezers. I am crusty and old but I would be that without the Telecaster (or liver spots for that matter). But my love of guitar has not diminished one bit.
Has the golden age of the Telecaster or any guitar passed in a world of electronic music, hip-hop, formulaic crapola? Who knows, not many folks now listen to "Has Anybody Seen My Gal" anymore as that era passed into history. However, my daughter, just slightly younger than you still loves guitar based music from Queen to the Beatles or Tom Petty et al, while still enjoying hip-hop etc.
Oh no, I've missed my 6 o'clock application of anti-aging cream. Gotta run.
Well, I was 16 when I bought my first Tele and that was in 1970. So, I wasn't always a crusty-old Tele-head. A bunch of Teles later, I work hard, to never get too "crusty."
Well, I was going to use John5, Chris Shiflett and Jack White as examples of young guys who play Telecasters, but now that I think of it, they're all probably in their late forties by now... I don't know if it's even relevant, but Keith Richards and Jimmy Page were young once.
****, I'm not very good at this.
There's plenty of young geezers to take our places......
I play in a band where I am amongst the youngest and in a band with gen g and y people. I just see them as musos and they me. There's no agism and whether I play Fender/Fender or PRS/Firebird/Marshall makes no nevermind.
I learn plenty from younger dudes. Worry less about age, more about participating.

You'll have to ask someone younger than me. I am circling the vortex of crust myself, gripping tightly to grunge as my self perception wages a losing battle against the encroachment of music that I fear I will soon refer to a "just noise"
I grew up with the Beatles (9 y/o when they hit Ed Sullivan) Stones, Hendrix, Clapton, etc. Fell into Johnny Winter and the Allman Bros. Hence my mainstay was a Les Paul. Still love the LP. I just joined the Tele club a little over a month ago. Never bonded with one in the early years but the Baja is fantastic and covers sooooooo much ground. Who cares if the younger audience moves on. The Tele, Les Paul and Strat are always in my realm.

It was the mid 1950’s when I first heard the telecaster sound on the radio...oops, there I go wandering off topic again just like the old geezer I am.
Must be. I am here.
Live long and Tele oh ye geezerites!
In a few years the Tele will have a press to play button and play itself. You can buy different chips to emulate the different sounds from the players past who actually took the time to learn how to play the instrument.

Hey.
Geezer-miner here/geezer in training.
Mostly just come here for the gear/music theory talk but occasionally I get sucked into the vortex with some of ya and expose my young idealistic colors.
I have no illusions though, it's only a matter of time before I'm the old guy reporting the young idealistic poster with lots of cynicism and things to say for making me a spot too uncomfortable.
It is the circle of life.
The forum is dominated by older folk. Probably have more expendable time, more cash to explore gear, and a desire to share life history, as life is winding down
Related, I think the disagreements we witness on forums between age groups ("old geezer!", and "egg-tooth millinials!") is microcosmic of what's going on in general. Kind of a age-class warfare. Young folks aren't given the power and license they believe they deserve, maybe unaware of what they don't yet know, and older folks over-value their experience levels and want to hang on to power. As a result, young folks retaliate and blame the older gen for everything, after all, the old folk are in control and made the decisions that got us here. The older gen retaliate, blaming the younger gen for being less experienced, disrespectful and hasty to take control before they are prepared. Combat ensues, which never ever solved any difficult problems for anybody, and the focus and energy turn to battle, instead of the problems and solutions.
An example is a music camp that I help with. The board is old. Instructors are old. Guess what the students look like? But we desperately want to engage younger students for all the right reasons. Some of us decide we need younger instructors and board members. Some board members are spooked at turning something over to less experienced folk. Some selected young staff like the idea, but don't follow thru with planning and prep, or decide they want to do something else right before the summer season and leave us hanging. I personally believe the solution is to have young folks running the thing, who understand they need experienced instructors, and maybe some consultation on how to administer a camp, what has worked and what hasn't. Still trying but haven't found the right mix of folk. I'm seeing the same exact need and trend at work. We find brilliant young folk, who ditch after a few years, right when they are about ready to take on more responsibility, or we have too many old folk who would rather do stuff themselves faster, than train younger folk. Still working on that too.
Maybe our generation just created a world that is too complicated, too high maintenance, and young folks are trying to tell us that?

I'm 64 and remember those days well. I recall being around 20 when I walked into a pawn shop one day only to find about a dozen Teles hanging on the wall. A sign nearby read something like "100 bucks for the beaters and 150 bucks for the ones in good shape." All were '50s and '60s Teles, and they hung there for a long time. If I had only known then what I know now......LOL.

You clearly aren't listening to the right modern music if a) you think the telecaster is losing any sort of relevance, and b) you agree with your assessment of modern music. Sure, the great stuff may not be en vogue right now, but it is damn sure out there.
I am 69 and a guitarist. This Fourm is about different subjects, not one was about age. We older people have learned a lot over the years. Plus look at us , it is your future.
Let me check...... Hair feel off my head onto my back, my chest dropped into my stomach and I'm complaining about unsupervised youth...nah far from geezer
Old. Geezer.
If you like telecasters, you're not old. Maybe operating out of a vintage body, but still young at heart.
You're not a geezer unless you care more about what your lawn looks like than what your Tele sounds like.
You just have to be a miserable git; age is of little consequence.
I object to the descriptor, crusty. The Tele is a geezer when I acquired one, 61 years old in 2007.
I love my Tele, and unless funk music is outmoded, then we'll both be alright.
So here's the thing: The Internet is only 23 years old. Liver-spotted boomers built the dang thing!
Young people these days think the Internet has always been here, and the same thing about Teles. Fact is, the Tele is older than the Internet, and while the Internet is still evolving, the Tele has pretty much reached perfection.
That means boomers have had access to the Tele since Day 1 (1946) and the Internet since Day 1 (1995). Thus, you're more likely to see a forum like this populated by us liver-spotted boomers.
But you kids are welcome, because one day you'll carry the torch. And become liver-spotted boomers yourself.
My OP

You are saying EXACTLY what I have been telling folks. It has taken me decades to warm up to the Telecaster and only in the last 5 years have I REALLY wanted one. In the pic below are 2 of my favorite guitars. The butterscotch Elite Tele on the right is my favorite GO TO guitar. When I was in my 20's all the way til my early 50's you couldn't give me a free Tele. I really hated the butterscotch color too. My wife STILL thinks Telecasters are ugly looking. I should have been locked in a room with a Tele and amp back decades ago and been told I wasn't going to be let out until I sat and played that guitar for 3 or 4 hours. Because I didn't like the way it looked I never would have picked one up and started playing. What caught my eye and made me want to check one out at the local music store was a video of Ray Buchanan literally tearing his Tele up with riffs I never heard before then. I have had my share of guitars over the years and a few were more expensive than my Tele but THIS Elite Tele is going to be with me until THE END Please excuse the fuzzy pic.

Deal. What kind of stuff are you into to begin with? That way I know which direction to point you!
Some quick suggestions:
Punk/noise: METZ, Girl Band
Pop punk: PUP
Punk/post: Meat Wave
Older but with great new albums: Superchunk, Hot Snakes, Wolf Parade, The National, Broken Social Scene
Throwback to the 70s: Greta Van Fleet
Grunge-y: Bully
Dream-pop: Alvvays, Anna Burch
Big loud rock and roll: Dirty Nil, Japandroids (earlier is more punk/lo-fi, newer is more rock and roll), Sam Coffey and the Iron Lungs (newest album)
These are just some of my current faves. Not sure if any of it is to your taste, but good luck.
Here’s BJM looking old and crusty playing “Geezers” enjoy.
I can happily say that my visits to music stores have very often treated me to seeing all different aged people taking hold of Telecasters and giving them a ride.
Some of my most intense Tele-centric discussions at my most local branch are with a relatively recent addition to the staff - I'm not certain of his age, but I'd put it at about half of mine (51 currently).
I can honestly say that I've also unintentionally persuaded some others to have a go, probably by way of the fact that I tend to check out Teles, but I play them various ways - if you take my meaning.
One minute, pure 'twang' behind the nut bends, straight up... change sounds/amps, and full tilt with those behind the nut bends with harmonics now standing in for double-locking trem pull-ups.
It's a solid instrument which gives back a lot - happily seeing the staff pointing people toward them when it's likely a good fit for the player helps pass the torch, so to speak.
I guess I'm at that interesting 'in-between' point...
Which is to say I feel like a 'crusty geezer' contextually =]

Fender should offer Liver Spot as a finish on an American Standard.Click to expand...
Can't be done. Liver Spotted is only available in nitrocellulose lacquer so it can't be used on the American Professional line. You must be a geezer if you still remember the American Standard line.
My puzzle is how they spray it. Must be the same process for spraying the polka dotted Buddy Guy Strats.
Played at a jam night the other evening, took an MIM Tele.
18 year old turned up to do a few songs of his own, and wanted to borrow an electric to use with his Looper.
A few guitars around, and he specifically asked if he could borrow my Tele.
"I love Teles" he said. I thought it'd be churlish to refuse;-)
Actually I was honoured.

Well done! Thank you.
The next time you’re in the hardware store’s plumbing section, walk down the toilet aisle and look at the absurd names of the different models.
I resemble that remark! And I have 2 Tele's as well.
In terms of product lifecycle, in the normal scheme of things, you'd expect a fairly simple design such as a Tele to have been consigned to history many years ago.
As a relative newbie to guitar-ing (albeit 56 years old) it seems quite refreshing that the Tele continues to be produced in a wide array of styles, specifications and price points.
Even if Tele production ceased right now, there's probably be more than enough out there, new and second-hand, to keep the model relevant for at least a couple of generations.
I'm not sure if the forum's demographic is "crusty old geezers", though. That said, I aspire to be an amalgam of Victor Meldrew and Father Jack when I get old.....

The forum is dominated by older folk. Probably have more expendable time, more cash to explore gear, and a desire to share life history, as life is winding down
Related, I think the disagreements we witness on forums between age groups ("old geezer!", and "egg-tooth millinials!") is microcosmic of what's going on in general. Kind of a age-class warfare. Young folks aren't given the power and license they believe they deserve, maybe unaware of what they don't yet know, and older folks over-value their experience levels and want to hang on to power. As a result, young folks retaliate and blame the older gen for everything, after all, the old folk are in control and made the decisions that got us here. The older gen retaliate, blaming the younger gen for being less experienced, disrespectful and hasty to take control before they are prepared. Combat ensues, which never ever solved any difficult problems for anybody, and the focus and energy turn to battle, instead of the problems and solutions.
An example is a music camp that I help with. The board is old. Instructors are old. Guess what the students look like? But we desperately want to engage younger students for all the right reasons. Some of us decide we need younger instructors and board members. Some board members are spooked at turning something over to less experienced folk. Some selected young staff like the idea, but don't follow thru with planning and prep, or decide they want to do something else right before the summer season and leave us hanging. I personally believe the solution is to have young folks running the thing, who understand they need experienced instructors, and maybe some consultation on how to administer a camp, what has worked and what hasn't. Still trying but haven't found the right mix of folk. I'm seeing the same exact need and trend at work. We find brilliant young folk, who ditch after a few years, right when they are about ready to take on more responsibility, or we have too many old folk who would rather do stuff themselves faster, than train younger folk. Still working on that too.
Maybe our generation just created a world that is too complicated, too high maintenance, and young folks are trying to tell us that?Click to expand...
weapons grade insight here
I posted a thread calling all young bands that got zero replies -- not that I expected many
the kids are busy livin', and I see this as the guitar world's front porch -- lots of rocking chairs and cigars
With maturity comes wisdom! And....you're as young as you feel...twang on!
I'm a damn dirty millennial and telecasters are still very popular with the bands in my age range (In about every genre). They're about as popular as offsets.
Guitar in general is still popular here despite what some people say. This is Missouri though and we tend to be 5 or 7 years behind the trends.

Perhaps it has been myopic of me to imagine that all the disembodied entities behind the posts are of similar characteristics to myself.
Do telecasters hold a particular sway over the liver-spotted boomers - the last remnant of a guard whose rearing was saturated in a music scene that the less-aged can only wistfully imagine?
Is there any room for the telecaster in today's stream-lined, instant gratification-obsessed, disposable, sterile commercial jingle-like music scene? Will time swallow up the cultural identity of a generation of yore, and compress it into bitesized ad-campaigns to compensate for the following's lack of?

Pray tell, keepers of history!Click to expand...
Yes (to the thread title)
But it's not specific to telecasters, in general, the guitar is fading from the world, slowly but surely. And the generation(s) that play/buy guitars are aging.
I'm 33. I started playing guitar when I was 12, and when playing guitar was the coolest musical thing you could do. I asked me 9 year old the other day if she had any interest in playing guitar, and she looked at me like I have 3 heads. She wants to learn keys/programming. I'm fine with that, but it's still pretty funny.
this how you know you are a geezer!

Hello all, first post. Just want to say I maybe old but I sure don’t feel crusty. Great site,good people. Really enjoying this site.
I think the grey wool socks and tennis shoes (steel toed) qualify me as a crusty geezer (at least in training). I have to have my hearing tested annually, no detectable hearing loss according to the charts, although as time progresses I seem to have some problems hearing at the frequency and timbre of my wife's speaking voice.

Hang on to that. Sitting behind the fashion curve gives you a good view when "popular" blows up in the faces of the stylish early adopters.
There is a lot of useful (and some not-so-useful) information and wisdom on these forums. It's why I signed up. I'm a younger guy and I traded in my Strat for a Tele, mainly because I was looking for a more accessable tonal experience. And I got it. I learned more about my playing style, more about my amps and pedals I think. That said, the Telecaster never went anywhere and never will. I find it has a great community built around it. Also, most of the new bands I listen to use the Tele to tap into that simple design and simple qualities, bridge for clear ringing riffs and neck for sexy smooth rhythm and doubling down on bass licks. Nothing like that cutting board jutting into your ribs!
You rang?

Logic should dictate that the Tele should've been stopped being made over half a century ago. Fender's Strat and offset guitars were superior designs to the Tele, at least guitar body wise. Yet the Tele survives like a cockroach.
Nope. I'm 36 and really enjoy this forum. Good people, great advice/discussion, and teles!
Telecasters are timeless therefore those who use them or are associated with them are timeless as well.
Gary
Woah, woah, woah. Who ya calling a crusty old geezer. I haven't even hit 30 yet and would like to think there are still some years ahead of me before I qualify.
I find the esquire/tele (i prefer esquire) to be extremely versatile. I am no country player (every player in my family is a country musician so i chose to break away). It works for country, rock, metal and just about anything else in my opinion. In the future, i dont know that the tele will always be in the foreground, but i bet as long as the guitar as an instrument is still relevant the tele will always have a place.
I'll be 68 tomorrow. I don't feel crusty and I don't feel old. What I like about this forum is the diversity. Younger, older, rock, county, jazz. The forum goes way beyond Telecasters. I enjoy reading perspectives very different from my own. So is this a forum for crusty old geezers? To me, it's a comfortable place where good people with shared interests come together. If I'm old and crusty to a few 30 somethings, I've been called worse. Just saying.
i listen to a lot of crust, d beat, and stench core.
Thy rod and thy staff and thy Tele shall comfort me. Always and forever!
What has made the Telecaster my 'go to' guitar and sets it above all others is the neck + bridge is series position of my five-way switch(es). I don't know why Fender don't make the five-way switch standard on modern Teles. This position gives humbucker sounds with depth and clarity. Before I discovered this mod, I was 335 guy. BB King, in one of his videos mentioned that he couldn't hear the high frequencies any more and I'm the same. I never use the bridge pickup position on my Tele because younger people would be cut in half if I used it at a level where I could hear it.
Seeing how I'm a crusty old geezer - YES!

Git off my lawn, ya damm kids....
This crusty old geezer started playing guitar at 12, in the bars at 15 and my first electric was a Japanese Yamaha SC1200 "work-of-art" that Fender craftsmanship couldn't touch in the '70's. Its just been the last few years I've come to appreciate Telecasters. Let me know when you'd like to jam!
I'm still a youngster (although I have been told repeatedly that I have the personality of a 60 year old man)
Springsteen killer Tele playing
I’m far from well versed on Springsteen’s catalog, though I did see him in concert once, and as I understand he always does, the Boss delivered big time.
I just wanted to express my appreciation for his playing on “Adam Raised a Cain”. Assuming he played it in the original recording, like I have seen him do on some live versions.
The work is so incredibly energetic, fairly simple and straightforward, boiled down pure rock. I just love it. It fits the mood of the raucous song perfectly. For me, it’s a really unforgettable example of what a Tele can do.
Bruce can definitely play more than he usually lets on to. Here's one of my favorite examples

He wrote in his autobiography that he once played a lot of blues-rock and did quite a bit of lead playing, but he went primarily to rhythm guitar once he switched his focus to his songwriting.

That makes perfect sense. I can relate, too. I know for ages I kept getting side tracked from writing songs because I would spend too much of what little time I had working on learning and practicing new guitar stuff, or concentrating on writing spiffy guitar parts - not that there is anything wrong with that. Then a couple of years ago I decided to focus on writing songs and to put most guitar practice on the back burner/in the back seat. I'm glad I did. I've developed my writing abilities far beyond where they were when I first started my focus on writing. To me, writing is a lot like practicing guitar in the time it takes and the progress I've made. So for me, it was a good trade-off as well. Glad to hear the Boss decided to do something similar!
There are examples of his young guitar hotshot days out there on YouTube. Steel Mill would be the band to look for. Audio quality is so-so at best, but he definitely had some chops.
I saw him in '02-ish, He did the majority of the leads, poor Steven and Nils got very little.
I Wish I were Blind, from Human Touch album, to me - was his best solo in studio. Best early work was On Wild and Innocent. His guitar always takes a backseat to his vocals. Couple of solo albums and tours - Bruce is a player. If you can find _ Live from Agora Ballroom 78 - That whole show is just great guitar work.
My favorite is his solo on "Candy's Room."

Bruce & Miami Steve can both play really well. But, no disrespect, Nils can play guitar on a whole other level.
Have a listen to his second album: "The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle"... Both the electric and the acoustic guitar work. It's all Springsteen.

I’m an older guy from NJ, but the first time I saw Springsteen was at the Capitol Theater in Passaic NJ in 1974. There lots of older musician friends who played that circuit who spoke of Springsteen as one of the hot guitar slingers from that era at the shore.
He's the Boss.
EDIT. And the reason why the Telecaster is my guitar.
If you listen to his very early days when he was with Steel Mill you can hear that he was pretty much a long jammer.
The other thing that I have always found interesting is that he seems to tune his electric guitar a little flat from the rest of the band. I think that purposely makes the solos stand out.
Edit: I didn't realize that someone had already commented on the Steel Mill days. Right on.

He played more lead guitar on the Darkness tour. I've never read why that was so, but it was a departure from earlier tours and something I haven't seen since.
Listening again to the lyrics of Adam Raised a Cain it strikes me that the song is one of his most personal. The song refers to a father who "walks these empty rooms looking for someone to blame".
Springsteen's dad worked as a bus driver and held other jobs. Douglas Springsteen suffered from mental health issues throughout his life which worsened in his later years. In his autobiography Bruce Springsteen admits that he has had to deal with depression.
Springsteen calls this song "emotionally autobiographical." The bitter but loving relationship between the father and son is similar to Springsteen's with his own father. Springsteen once said: "Our actual relationship was probably more complicated than how I presented it. Those songs were ways that I spoke to my father at the time, because he didn't speak and we didn't talk very much." https://www.songfacts.com/facts/bruce-springsteen/adam-raised-a-cain

I saw them twice on that tour (including the Phoenix show that clip in the second post is taken from) and he and STeve BOTH played a ton of lead in those shows, including some back and forth stuff you could almost call guitar battles. They were on fire on that tour. I saw them a lot, and they were almost always great, but those ‘78 shows were next level.
-Ray
The credits say Springsteen played all of the leads on “Darkness on the Edge of Town”. Steve van Zandt is listed as the rhythm player.
His work in the ‘70’s is still my choice if I want to listen to him.
It's really difficult to argue that he made the wrong choice when he decided to focus on songwriting instead of being a guitar hero.

I never liked "Glory Days" until I heard the version that contains the verse about his dad. That ties the whole song together. Wish they had kept it in. But then again, the song was massively popular so what do I know.
His playing on Thundercrack is what sold me on a telecaster years ago.
I need to get my ‘broadcaster’ built. The body is a Broadcaster clone built many years ago by a member here who has passed on. I have the big neck, and I have some original Joe Bardens. Dave Yeats....long time member here is probably thinking that this guitar will never be built since it has been ‘aging’ for years. Time has come, Dave. I listened to the 2009 concert in which Springsteen ‘covered’ the Darkness album live while I was trimming the bushes out front this afternoon. Fire....
It takes a really wise musician to step away from the lead spotlight in order to achieve something greater -- true band/ensemble playing. I love Springsteen's guitar style and not just in a "good playing for a singer" way. His back-and-forth with Tom Morello in "The Ghost of Tom Joad" that we see all the time is epic in the way it set up Morello. I think Bruce is really the voice, whether singing with words or in his guitar lines. The other players add and embellish. It's really brilliantly done by all.

I saw him in 09 and he played Darkness on the Edge of Town start to finish, among many other songs. He played every solo on Darkness note-for-note, despite having a hand brace of some kind at the time. I believe in his autobiography he mentions some surgery...but yeah Bruce is an underrated guitar player. Kinda always thought he would be a bigger deal on the TDPRI

Hell yeah, this kills. Great example of the telecaster doing it all just with a good amp and intelligent use of knobs. Great fun tune too.
Been a fan of the Boss since the 70s and really only love the first three albums. Having said that " Born to Run" is my favourite solo. Like his hero, Roy Orbison, it's got a catchy ( exciting) 7 note hook and goes on for more. He plays a lot of good 'uns but that's the one after 40+ years that still gets me excited.

Would that actually work? Seems like it might just make you sound bad.. Especially when you add a little rhythm to the mix. Curious about this.
Off-topic, but he doesn't get enough credit for his harmonica playing, either. And, like much of his stuff, it's best when he drops the bombast and just does it on its own terms.
Then there's his voice. Until his recent years, when he's resorted to that too-constant a Southwestern timbre, he had about 10 voices. He was a one-man-band of American tones, from raw rock-n'-roll fun to whispered worry to searing pain. Always with the great, great phrasing that you can hear so well here:
With Mr. Prine now gone, we don't have too many around who can voice someone who came back from a murky war too shattered to have been the father he wanted to be, as he found solace where he could until he can, here, say sorry to his now-grown kid.
There's also this:
And this, bending almost machine sounds into a real sigh of the soul.

If you think about it, most electronic tuners (not really good ones) are only accurate to 1 cent +/-. So, theoretically even your average band may be out of tune by that much if they just relied on garden variety electronic tuners. (Seeing how a lot of guitarists keep a clip on on their headstocks, I may not be too far off on that assumption.) I am not saying that I am absolutely correct, but I would be curious if anyone else shares my observation about his pitch during solos.

1 cent is not even audible. I'm sure that bands , even good famous ones, are often "out" by a few cents. This happens in the course of playing. Heck, even your own guitar is out with itself by more than that due to the physics of the instrument.
To be purposely out though, I've never heard of that. Not saying it's not true.
All of Bruce Springsteen's music is of Merit and or great. But his first four albums through Darkness are exceptional rock and roll, and this was before he cutback on his lead guitar playing for songwriting. Pure StreetWise poetry, and in the case of Darkness on the edge of town, pure anger at the establishment and his manager in particular. And it showed and every venue he played, and I was there in Phoenix in 1978, and let me tell you, dancing on top of a grand piano playing leads, sliding halfway across the stage on his knees coming to a stop under Clarence where the big man would belt out a sax solo. That's my lasting image of Bruce and his tele. And a band so tight, I'm sure they needed a stiff drink and soak in a hot tub just to get their nuts hanging in the right place again

This thread just popped to life again and I happened to see your post - must have missed it first time through. I was at that Phoenix show as well (or was it Tempe - I thought it was at ASU). I also saw them in Tucson a few months later on that tour in I think November. They played Because The Night so ungodly hot I thought the roof was coming off the place - I could hardly breathe. I caught them in Phoenix again in November 1980 on The River tour. It was OK, but I didn't think it was in the same league as those '78 shows...

3 rd of July 88 was my first show. Maybe thats why I loved that tourClick to expand...
I am from Sweden and the first part of this show was broadcasted through out the whole world on radio. The rest was for the audience at the Olympia Stadium in Stockholm. To this day I hold that concert as my best Bruce concert ever. Was happy when he decided to release it officially.
Been a huge Springsteen fan since the release of Born to Run, and my Winterland 78 Bootleg was my most prized records (3 LP set) of my youth. Back then, no one was better than him live.
Born to Run is why I bought my first Tele in 1978, and I think he is one of the greatest post 60's songwriters ever, but, have never been enthralled with his lead playing or solos.
I remember when Darkness came out, and a lot of the reviews at the time called it "his return to being a guitar hero" , but I never heard that in his playing. Sure the 1978 live "Prove it all Night" workouts were ok, but never that great or interesting to me.
To me, he neither has a unique sound (unlike Knofpler), or played very lyrically (unlike Gilmour, Clapton).
I love him and his work, and no one looked cooler pictured with an Esquire/Tele ever, but his actual playing leaves me "meh".

Same here - solo starts at 2:00. Riffs mixed in with singing before and after. I honestly doubt that is Bruce Springsteen.

I need to get my ‘broadcaster’ built. The body is a Broadcaster clone built many years ago by a member here who has passed on. I have the big neck, and I have some original Joe Bardens. Dave Yeats....long time member here is probably thinking that this guitar will never be built since it has been ‘aging’ for years. Time has come, Dave. I listened to the 2009 concert in which Springsteen ‘covered’ the Darkness album live while I was trimming the bushes out front this afternoon. Fire....

I love Nils, especially with Grin, his first band, and his Neil Young work.
Truth is that Bruce's music has always been built and more focused around the piano work of Roy Bittan (especially post 1975), than around the guitar.
Born to Run was the first album I bought, when it came out at the end of summer of 75. I started gassing for guitars around then. But when you listen to that album, except for the title track, there is hardly any guitar on in at all. Thunder road, 10th Ave, Backstreets, Meeting across the river, Jungleland (even though it has a short guitar solo) are all built around the piano.

Yeah, he grew up in Bethesda, near DC, he says he would always check in on Roy when he was in town. They were on some PBS show in the early 70's (see below) as well and The Grin song "White Lies" was always on DC/Baltimore radio back then.
I grew up in Baltimore, so saw Roy, Danny Gatton, all those guys. Nils always played with the thumb pick, very unusual for "non country" players of that ear.

Yes I read somewhere Nils felt ashamed even today trying to steal the show from Roy. But he Said it was because he was Young. Nils Held Roy Buchanan, Jeff Beck and Jimi Hendrix as the best guitar players ever.
I grew up dancing to Shotghe mid-‘70s...every band that played our dances 0layed it. All of them did a better job than the cut above. That is also the most indulgent solo and the worst playing I have ever hear come out of Lofgren’s fingers. Ommv. But...Buchanan’s face seems to say he agreed....and then.....Buchanan’s tuning exploration...oh well.....I guess you had to be there in an altered state??????
Side note: I still own a mic stand just like those...with the chrome covered base. People have tried to buy it....not for sale.
Well he Said he was very nervous.
I read I think in the Peter Carlin book about Bruce that Nils went on before him about early seventiies. And Bruce Said that he would never go up after Nils again. Anyway Bruce and Nils were friends long long before he joined E Street band.
Here is Nils Excuse
As a person from the Sweden,
I am very surprised how they through together his ( Bruces) first short European tour. London, Amsterdam and Stockholm got the gigs. London is a given, Amsterdam understandable but Stockholm ( my hometown) seems a bit odd. But off course honored he paid us a visit that early in the career. It was a small venue in Stockholm taking 2000 people. Very close to the center of Stockholm and Also a place where they have parts of the Nobel price celebrations. However out of 2000 having seen that concert that by the way got super revues in the press, today it is a standing joke that 2000 went in and 50 000 came out ( everybody had seen the concert In retrospect). There was a party for Bruce after the concert but he prefered to go to a McDonalds nearby and have a hamburger. Lucky for him the first McDonalds restaurant had arrived in Sweden just 2 years earlier.

And as good a guitar player Nils is. He off course cannot be compared the best guitarist ever ( Roy Buchanan). But an interesting side note I read was as he was teached by Roy how to play the licks he realised he would never be able to play them the way Roy ( as Roy is a genius) did but he found other ways of playing Roys stuff and made some adjustments to better fit his playing and used what he had learned to of Roy to make his own style of playing.
Roy appearantly Also defended the small Nils among his people saying he is with me, so noone would mess with Nils. Roy never made it big but at least he could see a student at the biggest of stages between 84 and 88. Coming to think of it Fender had to be very pleased that period when Bruce was the biggest Star on earth ( 84 to 88) Fender must have been really happy with their exposure. Bruce Tele Nils Strat.
Bruce is an excellent guitarist. On the "Wild & Innocent..." album he plays all the guitars, and some bass and mandolin. He's also a decent piano player. But he's not a show-off, only what the song requires. There was never much emphasis on sound quality either. All of that plus try playing while running around like a maniac. The guitar was not the star.

Thats whats good with forums everyone has their own taste. I respect that.
This is nice from Both Bruce and Nils
I've seen him many times and a few times up close and the guy can play. He chooses (I think) to sing / write / express / conduct / a proselytize rather than be known a guitar slinger.
I once saw GRIN Nil's band and he opened the show playing guitar bouncing on a trampoline from behind the Marshall stacks. At one point he did a forward leap / flip over the amps and landed center stage still playing.
His playing kept getting better but his knees didn't.

Ever wonder why contemporary music sucks?
I saw this and every word is true!
Woah!
20 Minutes.
No way

Wot Boubou said. Not all of it sucks but I'm not sure I want to devote 20 mins to watching something that proves why I don't like what I don't like.
I like lots,of contemporary music, just not much of what is on the radio.
Songwriting is a science. Who knew? Duh.

I take it you're a big fan of Wayne Newton and Chuck Mangione.
I didn't bother watching it, I've seen similar rants. Couldn't take more than 30 seconds. Video's just as bad as the music.
Long, but worth watching. Intelligent, evidence based. Not a rant.
There are some truths in the video but plenty of opinion as well.
I watched that video two nights ago and it makes a lot of sense. repietition= familiarity.
Whoas -Hmmn. The Millennial whoop. God I yearn for Linda Ronstadt's single note semi-breves and Roy Orbison' s voice. Whole notes suspended over some bars with no warbling.
Lyrics are not like the complexity of early Springsteen songs either.
Compression- yep and exposure for more familiarity.
Oh and the big one- MONEY. to make sales you need lots of investment.
I like the speakers point that years ago musicians had to be " bloody talented" and not sloppy.
We'd buy records and then repetition would see us seeking out the nuances in music.
Like him, my head is stuck back about 50 years ago in the 60s and 70s. But thet's just me.
The analysis of 500,000 songs ( if true) suggests a great deal of support for this view- music is crappier now, moreso than ever, and, has in fact, been declining for decades.
No doubt I'll get c... over my comments and agreement with this man's views. But it is a free world and you and I are entitled to our opinions.
P.S Interesting pronounciation of TIMBRE a French word that varies all over in pronounciation.
Ah yes, whenever I listen to music, the very first thing I listen for is timbral pallette homogenization and harmonic complexity. That is surely the best way to figure out if a song is any good.
grandpa is always gittin riled up about what them kids is up to
I don't need analysis of 500k recordings to know that modern music is going down the toilet. The performers are not artists, they are puppets of the fatcats who are raking in piles of cash.
I'll stop now before i get in trouble...
...because I'm getting old.
I'm sure my parents said the same thing about 'modern music' too.
Really good video. Lots of good information here.
Every generation has it’s fair share of embarrassing music.
For my money - it is the educational system. John Coltrane (one of the greatest jazz musicians) was a fully formed MUSICIAN out of high school - as no doubt were many others.
Today - the music programs in many school systems are non-existent and have been decades.
I had a day job in a public school 30 yrs ago that didnt even have GYM.

This is the point I think that gets lost when we pine for older generations' music. When music is current, all the bad stuff and the noise is still accessible, but over time only the good stuff remains easily accessible.

That goes on the assumption that the kids you want off your lawn only ever listen to what's current.
Maybe I'm just fortunate to hang around the right people, but most kids I know who are my daughter's age listen to a surprising amount of the stuff I grew up with. Not to say they don't listen to current stuff, too, but painting all of them with the same broad brush doesn't give them a fair shake.
There are a few gems in current music, but that's your loss.
Very interesting video (watched the whole thing). I agree that lots of modern music is bland, repetitive and basically forced upon the masses through slick marketing. But there are many exceptions to this rule and there are very talented players, singers, and songwriters who are out there bucking the trend.
Speaking of repetitive, I have noticed that dozens of pop songs over the past decade use a version of the chord sequence Am-F-C-G (repeat). Why? Maybe someone determined scientifically that this particular chord sequence stimulates dopamine production in the brain. Maybe it's the only chord sequence those two songwriters (who apparently write all the hit songs) know. Sheesh. Doesn't anyone teaches jazz chords anymore??
People have been coming up with reasons why the new music sucks for at least 80 years. IMO it’s the same reason the youngins think the old music sucks.
It’s a lack of context with a good helping of closed mindedness.
I also have gotten too old to keep up on everything and there is a good bit of music that I prefer not to hear. But even if I don’t appreciate the music someone is making, it’s become hard for me to completely disregard it. I’ve done that in the past with acts that I have grown to love.
If I can’t/won’t appreciate some music or art the fault is mine not the art.
And also GET OFF MY LAWN.

Seriously. Variations on that progression get used by loser newcomers like The Beatles (Let it Be), Iggy Pop (The Passenger), Bob Marley (No Woman No Cry), Dire Straits (Romeo and Juliet), John Denver (Take Me Home, Country Roads), U2 (With or Without You), Men at Work (Down Under), Red Hot Chili Peppers (several songs), The Scorpions (Still Lovin' You), The Cranberries (Zombie), The Police (So Lonely), Toto (Africa) and, if I dare blaspheme the name of the most holy Keith Richards, The Rolling Stones (Beast of Burden).
Don't get me started on all of the awful stuff that's used the I-IV-V progression...
"The hook" is not new. It's been used in film, the risk of producers and investors, for years.
One Hook that got me was the introduction to "Reelin' in the Years" wow it's good. It is also melodic- part or mostly based on the song's melody.
Yes blues lovers are living the musical base of Robert Johnson. It's a free country and their right to like it.
Opera and Classical music is repeated by orchestras nightly. Again- choice
What gets me about "modern music" is that as it is narrowing in most directions, it takes little or no imagination or talent to create. Another Millennial symptom. A machine will do it for you. That's not choice, it's repetition gone extreme.
I pity today's young. They won't play like Yes, create great songs like " American Pie" and many others. Where is the sensitivity of a Jim Croce song like " I have to Say I Love you in a Song". I, and anyone here, could cite many of their likes but , more importantly, what can we do to help?
Here in Adelaide, South Australia, we have an AM radio station ( yep AM) and it plays older music and kids here are liking it and buying vinyl. There is hope ( I hope).
The most iconic I-vi-IV-V examples of pop I can think of are Stand By Me and Unchained Melody. I'm sure songwriters used it before then. But my point is that it must have become a recognizable enough chord progression for Pop music styles by the 50s. That was 70+ years ago.
As much as I long for "music of the past that doesn't suck as much as it does now", the reality is that nothing has really changed much at all since the rise of vinyl singles and disc jockeys.
There will always be music of the most (EDIT: I mean least) common denominator. It's just that we are used to radio and MTV acting as mediators. Now with the internet, we can find whatever we want. We can also publish whatever we want. But since it's so easy to publish, it takes more work to find and market the jewels, with more risk. Record companies now have to consolidate and focus their efforts even more on formulaic production and branding than ever before.
I can complain as much as any about the horrible state of mass marketed music. But then I remember I don't listen to it by choice. I have more than enough options to tailor my music listening experience than ever before. The stuff the video is talking about, though recognizable in structure, still sounds foreign in production and presentation. It sucks for sure. But there is lots out there that doesn't suck. We're musicians. We can go create music that doesn't suck.

When music appreciation went from
to this
Then this
and now this
Do we really need to wonder what happened to music?
...funny how the music industry is flooded with Apple computers and software to produce recordings for less and less capable listening devices, that they also produce. (They bought Beats headphones company to counteract the trend of people migrating away from earbuds).
Earbuds encourage higher compression with heavy beats and shouting over clear singing and guitar music.

Yeah, that's not an opinion I can support. Sorry. We don't all think Stevie Nicks is the be-all and end-all of sexy. (In fact, some of us don't find her sexy at all and didn't back in the 70s, either.)
Rock music died in the 90s and has been nothing but repetitive and without innovation for at least twenty years. It's not the pretty girls' fault. At least they're pleasant to look at!
ETA: Based on some of the comments here, it seems that repetition is one of the evils killing music? Really? How many times has the old D - C - G been beaten into the ground, e.g. Sweet Home Alabama, Werewolves of London, All Summer Long (all the same song!), most of CCR's output, half of Bob Seger's catalog, etc., etc.

Well, I was referring to that four chord sequence specifically, starting with the minor chord. A good example is "Save Tonight" by Eagle-Eye Cherry. The songs you list above don't follow that sequence, though they may have it embedded somewhere in the verse or chorus.
(PS: I like "Save Tonight" - great song! Cool, subtle slide guitar at the end. )
I don't, because it doesn't.

come on now , thats a generalization, no need to get nasty, it if you watched it , it points out some thing I noticed while engineering in the 80's and 90's , the structured formulas for recording , it states 2 things , that are preveailent in the recording industry today ,
1) most big name bands or talent as it were follow a set pattern of recording that is over compressed removing a dynamic range that was present in the 60's during the experimental recording days
2) most of the big hits today are written by mostly 2 guys, giving a lot of the same flavours to alot of the lyrics and music style
I noticed with alot of the same style of recording during the 70's,80's, 90's where it culminated with drums Up front and formost , guitars, bass, and synths, on top , and vocals riding on top of that
so Radiocaster, before you start slinging the brown stuff , be educated and know your stuff , I am in no way discussing musical content , just the recording companies control over their clients ability abilty to cookie cut music to the masses , which is the content of the video.

this is my point exactly, recording companies pump what sells , if you saw that part of the video , its been around forever, kind of like when large corporations got involved in music in the 60's , we had the monkeys , and AM radio , FM was for playing whole album sides etc, but the generic cookie cutter stuff was crammed doown our throats
this not about individual music its about the formulation of music and how its pushed to the public. that confirmed what I had suspected since the 60's just now its larger

then why did you post you had a choice ,bud and you made it, so are complaining because its 20 min long or the title of the piece becuse you never saw it and its monday morning?
Good video. The most salient point is the record company's reduction of risk. Years ago a company might spend a few grand developing 10 acts knowing if they broke one it would pay for the rest. That process allowed you to see 10 great bands live for a few quid each. Now you get less choice for more money.
Thankfully artists who are driven by genre usually have a loyal following of that genre to access still. But pop music and rap are ugly, cut-throat industries.

We're musicians. We can go create music that doesn't suck.Click to expand...
I have no problem with any style of music, be it now or or from the past and Im not complaining about any thing here , I find the process as a whole totally fascinating, even my kid , although she is strong on middle of the Road , vocal harmony , styled music and super strong on instrument orchestration its an interesting paradyme shift

Ditto (via Spotify and Soundcloud) here. Unsurprisingly, there is good stuff out there if people would stop whining about the tiny sliver of music put into their ears by mass media companies and television as somehow emblematic of the entire "world" of music.Click to expand...
It gets into economics and toward politics but yesterday I had a really funny conversation with a news junkie and wise elder. All of a sudden one said if we have to have the 50s or 60s again they'd prefer important parts of the real vs modern imagined now versions. The wise elder gave some really good examples of more people open to or accepting change in important ways. I bring this up because music was included in the topics. A person who had Nat King Cole and Perry Como as stars accepting Elvis and The Beatles etc....
The only paradigm shift that's happened is how people listen to music, and how music is more available to listen to than it ever was..
Maybe that's devalued the art. Maybe it hasn't. But I wish I'd had a smartphone and Spotify when I was 20.

There was tons of good music around when I was a youngster in the 70s, but you wouldn't know it from listening to the singles charts. In the UK at any rate.
Personally I think that sweeping statements along the lines of 'All modern music is rubbish' suck. But that's like just my opinion man Click to expand...
I was reading this thread and thinking about those repeats of TOTP you get on BBC4 from the 70s and 80s ( well, the episodes they can show that are not fronted by sex offenders or racists). The Nolans, The Dooleys all that kind of stuff. Hit records that we've attempted to erase from our collective memories.
Music has never been so diverse ( that's the logical progress of history) so what do we even think modern music is? EDM? Grime? Norwegian death metal? Russian hip hop? Nu folk? Nu blues?
The charts sell downloads and streaming to 13 year olds and TV talent shows sell them to their grandmothers. Popular music charts have never been so economically or culturally insignificant in our life times yet at the same time music has never been more diverse or accessible. It's a good time to be a music fan whether that's listening to something new or exploring the vast archives that are now so easy to get to.

The most iconic I-vi-IV-V examples of pop I can think of are Stand By Me and Unchained Melody. I'm sure songwriters used it before then. But my point is that it must have become a recognizable enough chord progression for Pop music styles by the 50s. That was 70+ years ago.Click to expand...
Stand By Me, Unchained Melody, Earth Angel, and every other song that was derived from Doo Woop in the '50s, right up to Since You Been Gone (Rainbow) and More Than A Feeling (Boston) in the '70s, and All of Me (John Legend) today.
A good progression is a good progression. So long as it allows for new melodies, who cares what the chords are?
Way back when, there was a thing in the church, where instruments were viewed as a "bad" thing, and religious songs were performed "a cappella" (as in the chapel). Folk musicians with their violins and lutes and whatever were purveyors of bad influence and sin. Not only that, folk music enticed
the peasants to DANCE, how sinful. Years later, the church subsidized composers and funded orchestras. Lots of nice music was written and performed.
Along comes the organ, and every church has to have one. Organs put lots of musicians out of work, with their multi-keyboards, foot pedals, and dozens of sounds that emulate instruments. For every one of these drastic changes in music, there were preservationists who wanted to cling to a style from the past.
At the turn of the 20th century, Jazz was invented in New Orleans, and sin was in. Jazz was the new music, conceived by minorities, adopted by all sorts. Old fashioned folks thought it was going to be the downfall of our youth ... they would listen to Jazz, smoke weed, dance with minorities ... the old folks were not amused. Jazz was new, it was sinful, and it sounded all sexy and tempting.
In the 50s, many TV shows featured lip-syncing. Teen heart-throbs would dance around to a crowd of young partiers while the audio department wired a tape machine to the sound system, and voila ... no band, just a celebrity lip-syncing to the hits. Teen idols would go on tour, performing at high schools, community centers and roller rinks, literally lip-syncing to a turntable piped into a public address system.
The main difference in Pop music now days is technology and profit-potential. As technology allows new ways to produce mediocre music for the masses, profit is realized ... because you don't need Mozart or Louis Armstrong to appeal to the consumer if you have synthesizers, samplers, auto-tune and attractive young teen idols. Technology and greed ... as corporate profits go up because of music technology, TV, and the internet, the demand is for audio/visual based drug analogues that distract the masses from the reality that giant corporations are getting richer for feeding a huge swath of consumers musical "pink slime".
I like old music, but I really don't care what the hoi-polloi digests. There will always be a market for Fabian, Lesley Gore, Kanye West, Cher, and Taylor Swift. There will always be music lovers of all ages who want to preserve the well crafted music of bygone eras. The only thing new is that technology allows for an even faster assembly line of Pop mediocrity.
Damn , I kicked a hornets nest!
I bet that woke up afew people , good morning!

A-flippin-men to all of this
I think my motivation for this thread was that I was fascinated by low risk of the music industry to put things out there and to back up thier acts , like Avril lavigne, beeber , Lady Gaga, Brittney,
etc. how compressed the audio signal have become partially because of the media for playback MP3 etc, how the same thread of writting is prevailent ( commercial hits here) but this was noticed by in in the 70's, with the over stated recording formulas, its like in the Movie THX 1138 , Please turn in you Blue Cubes , this week its red cubes, Consume , consume , consume.
but from my prospective it has nothing to do with the music of today, or the past 40 years or style or genre , but a glimpse into the machinery that drives what we hear.

If it didn't sell, it wouldn't get made.
Why should music be exempt from the dead hand of free market capitalism?

A free market is a theory. In reality, consumers are brain-washed by predatory marketing ... analogous to a free election, which isn't so free if the politicians successfully lie to the voters. There is no free market, it's bought and paid for.

Popular music has always been pabulum for the masses. It's easier, and cheaper, to churn out and disseminate these days which is why there's more of it.
Supply and demand feed off each other.

"The hook" is not new. It's been used in film, the risk of producers and investors, for years.
One Hook that got me was the introduction to "Reelin' in the Years" wow it's good. It is also melodic- part or mostly based on the song's melody.
Yes blues lovers are living the musical base of Robert Johnson. It's a free country and their right to like it.
Opera and Classical music is repeated by orchestras nightly. Again- choice
What gets me about "modern music" is that as it is narrowing in most directions, it takes little or no imagination or talent to create. Another Millennial symptom. A machine will do it for you. That's not choice, it's repetition gone extreme.
I pity today's young. They won't play like Yes, create great songs like " American Pie" and many others. Where is the sensitivity of a Jim Croce song like " I have to Say I Love you in a Song". I, and anyone here, could cite many of their likes but , more importantly, what can we do to help?
Here in Adelaide, South Australia, we have an AM radio station ( yep AM) and it plays older music and kids here are liking it and buying vinyl. There is hope ( I hope).Click to expand...
Your location reminded me of a “newcomer “ I discovered (he has a song called Adelaide)...Joe Robinson. Very talented guitarist, singer and songwriter.

A couple of years ago my daughter discovered the Ramones, the Sex Pistols and Velvet Underground, and was soon raving about them to anyone who would listen...she later asked me, "Why doesn't anyone know about those AWESOME bands?"
I explained that they were an underground, niche band that was popular amongst a rare audience and, at least down here in Texas, there wasn't a whole lot of radio play happening, outside of the rare, brave-DJ-at-1-in-the-morning-boss-isn't-listening occurance...they're more popular and widely known now than they were back into 70's.
I think there's still good music out there, and with the advent of the Internet and good home recordings, it's easier to find.
BTW, there ain't nothing wrong with Katie Perry--if you turn off the sound and just watch the video.
I would say music in general is way better than it's ever been.
More varied, more women, better recorded, the list goes on. There are styles and genres that didn't exist 10-20 years ago - Grime, modern ambient, etc etc.
Old styles like Prog are getting updated (for the better, mostly).
Oh, and guitars are better than they've ever been, too.

the post was not a slam on the artists or thier music but on the dynamiics of the recording. My kid 21yrs old now, is into full orchestrations as well as korean boy bands (who knew)
she plays first Oboe in the orchestra , and was wired on 7 days grace.
KP is cute , so's Avril Lavigne ( I took my kid to see her in concert that 3'nothing worked her tail off)

You're right, all that recording history - too much perspective, man!
I think the consumption of music has made the huge difference between now and the days of vinyl and cassette. And this is largely driven by the consumer.
Death to mp3! Long live mp3!
"I don't need analysis of 500k recordings to know that modern music is going down the toilet. The performers are not artists, they are puppets of the fatcats who are raking in piles of cash."

Not to mention that it's become dirt cheap to produce and distribute, too. Less than a thousand dollars' worth of hardware and software and an Internet connection pretty much lets a single musician become his own record company.

come on now , thats a generalization, no need to get nasty, it if you watched it , it points out some thing I noticed while engineering in the 80's and 90's , the structured formulas for recording , it states 2 things , that are preveailent in the recording industry today ,
1) most big name bands or talent as it were follow a set pattern of recording that is over compressed removing a dynamic range that was present in the 60's during the experimental recording days
2) most of the big hits today are written by mostly 2 guys, giving a lot of the same flavours to alot of the lyrics and music style
I noticed with alot of the same style of recording during the 70's,80's, 90's where it culminated with drums Up front and formost , guitars, bass, and synths, on top , and vocals riding on top of that
so Radiocaster, before you start slinging the brown stuff , be educated and know your stuff , I am in no way discussing musical content , just the recording companies control over their clients ability abilty to cookie cut music to the masses , which is the content of the video.Click to expand...
Yeah, the production sucks, but look at 50s stuff. 3 chords only, except for doo-wop which used 4 chords. Jazz doesn't count because the complicated stuff is not poppy.

and their parents before them , ever hear of the responce from Mozarts surprize symphony , same crap, its not a slam on the music of today , its an eye opener of the manipulation of the music from its creation, to the format, to whats dished out to the public, dont think that the performers have any thing to do with it, most dont write their own music, but its in the financial backing from the industry and how its delivered , and how the over compression of the mastered tunes removes alot of the dynamics that was present in the past, it has nothing to do with genre just the time and evolution to the industry.

I've mentioned this before, but nobody can say who has talent or not when they have not attempted to get into (or listening with an open mind) drum sequencing, sampling, mixing, or MC-ing. I can't trash a cello player as a no-talent hack if I can't even master my own instrument. So this idea that modern tech makes for talent-less, lazy musicians is a false idea to me. We already had those before auto-tune was invented. I know the same part of our human minds that feels a beat and thinks a melody is the same that younger generations feed through new machines. If one thinks we are supposed to play acoustic/semi-acoustic stringed instruments forever to make 'real music', they'd be closing their minds to what makes music and art special. Music boundaries are a choice, for sure, and I have a preference for non-metal music, but I still love metal, I have thrash roots. I certainly don't squat on their black doom parade
I'm gonna assume that video is 20 minutes of someone repeating: "it's because you are 4 decades old and it actually doesn't suck it's just that now you have finally become the old fart who thinks ''boy they just don't make music like they used to''"
sure you could try to define why it sucks and ascribe meaningful comparative descriptors to your thoughts, but after all you'll still be the old guy who can't relate to music that millions of young people like. I hear plenty of good stuff on the radio... it's mostly in the background music. afa lyrics, well a dylan, waitts, springsteen only comes around so often.

Putting on my tinfoil hat.
Music can't stand on its own anymore to sell. It's essentially free now to distribute recorded music. Labels and producers can't sell music directly to listeners. They never did to begin with. But they really can't now. I think their market must be retail and media corporations, who in turn use it for emotional appeal to hook consumers. It has to be highly formulaic, and produced in a way that somehow augments the consumer experience. That's the only way I can make sense of it.
The only time I hear Nickelback, Katy Perry, or this week's bro-country artist is at a hair salon or Walmart. Is it just that I generally don't choose to listen to these acts? Or is there something about the way these acts are produced that seems to fit well in retail environments? Just sayin'.
Back in the 80s Ted Nugent said that Muzak was uncool. So now we have iHeart Radio, instead. Same thing, as far as I'm concerned.
Whether or not it is planned to be that way, or whether retail corporations in particular have a stake in land and audio streaming platforms nowadays is anyone's guess.
But consider the amount of people who go to trendy clothing stores specifically to buy screen t-shirts with nothing but the clothing store logo screened on. Just sayin'.
Theres been garbage in every generation, however, being old, and listening to todays pop and alternative -
not much connects with me. Quite a lot of it sounds robotic, cut and pasted and quantized to a grid and auto-tuned to death, and I simply dont like that sound. The rock bands seem somehow un-melodic, altho, my old man probably said the same thing about Grand Funk and Zeppelin.
Theres good stuff too, I happen to like some stuff by Lady Gaga.

exactly , but unlike today the technology back then had not been developed , Hendrix was good because, he was the first to do what he did with what was available, Page , clapton, beck the same , every thing was in its infantcy, now comes nike , coke, and big money sponsers , every thing gets homongenized to mainstream technology moves so far ahead that an idiot like me can build a superstudio in my living room and any twit can punch out tunes at home , I blame Lester Paufess for adding a second head stack to his ampex reel to reel and multitracking was born!
social norms play alot into the time of the music and also the given freedoms of acceptability , but nothing has to do with the genre, only where it is on the evolutionary scale, welcome to the future , its a white washed version of the past , with a few more bells and whistles.

I dont mind alot of her stuff and I tell you she works very hard, but it only because she is moulded by the industry , and the creative process is not some thing she built, but was defined off the basic ideas of her persona she created and developed by the money backers.
one difference between now and then... back then, the best bands really were championed on the radio, at least the FM radio.
It was easy to find the really great bands, instrumentally as well as total overall effort.
Today? sure theres great music being made but ask on any music forum.... you have to dig for it. Its overwhelmed by the 10zillion sub-average to mediocre bands and everybody on earth is now releasing their own music. Its a flood of stuff.
I've said this before, but the last good band I had that made a CD and started to get some kind of interest from the suits... one "freelance AnR guy" told me he wasnt even listening to bands CDs anymore. He was "scouting" the modeling agencies because he could fake anything but cute. Maybe he was just a perve, but, I think you can point to that comment, and then take it to a crazy tangent, and you have described half of todays pop radio stars.

no its more about the dynamics or lack of dynamics in todays music , how the industry proceeds with it, why there is a common thread in todays music , at what point these shifts occurred and the way the music industry approaches backing its talent, that gives us what we have today and why its acceptable .
now think about this , in the 50's, 60s, 70,.....etc who bought the music we did , now there is a new generation or 4 -5, that will continue to support the money making machinery untill they are in the thier 60's or so and the technolgy will shift a thousand times before the millenials are old , then who will buy the music and how will it change?

if that is what the video aspired to , you would be correct , but its not , it has to do with the music industry machinery and how it has adapted to the present day technology and how its output is presented to the masses , the only comparative past to future is in the recording and mastering process and how the fidelity and dynamics are shifted to accomodate todays technology, useing the euphamism that the dynamics in the music today is missing due to the over compression thus making it " sound like Crap " but that familiarity is injected so that if you hear it over and over and you adjust!
EG Seven Nation Army- White stripes , fresh sound interesting format, so overplayed on the radio every one got sick of it,and maybe in a while in the future may be worth a second listen and there maybe a hidden gem in there somewhere.

well, its not really a market anymore.
one thing that HAS changed... your chances of being a music star now, or making a real good living... are worse than ever. Illegal downloading was a major head blow to the industry, and the artists, but its nothing compared to streaming. Thats screwed everybody five ways to sunday.
My college age daughter pays a tiny fee to spotify so she can stream and play her Playlist anywhere she goes, even if she's offline. She told me neither her, nor any of her friends, buy music anymore. theres this unspoken law or concept that music is now free, or nearly free.
I dont know if that has any bearing of "quality" of music, but, you'd be better off going to college for a degree in Burgerology. You can make a living doing music, we have guys right here doing it - but your odds are worse than ever.
Odd that people are commenting without watching the vid. As I songwriter I found it very fascinating. No rant, but a series of observations that, granted, some might be jumping to conclusions, but most of it makes sense to me. I do agree that technology has had a powerful influence (although that started in the Leo/Les era, so gotta be careful where that technology line is drawn), but certainly the recording industry is mostly to blame. Since I don't know squat about those two songwriters mentioned, I want to know more about them. Thanks for posting.
Of course, I'm not and never have been much of a pop music fan even back in the 60s (including the Beatles) and pretty much believe that the pinnacle occurred with Jimi.

although I did not post to your responce , I am responding to it
I personally like to hear fresh approaches to music , different formulations, instruments and originality , ( but thats my thing ) I like if I had a heart -fever Ray , deffinately not for every one I can assure , but new and really different , I like david Gilmour with the Orb ( instrumental ) but new I like the electric manderine tour -tangerine dream ( just before Edgar frose Died ) but a new approach for them.
The answer is not hard to understand.
1. Young women are larger consumers of music.
2. Young women have bad taste.
3. Record labels sell music based on the tastes and preferences of the most important segment of the commercial market.

We are not the public. Or rather, a bunch of musos on a guitar forum are not the general public. I think it's less about what people want to hear, and more about what people think they are supposed to want to hear, because they really haven't had any reason or motivation to question otherwise.

The vast majority of people in america are not "musically literate or knowledgable". They dont care about the mechanix of it, or how much work went into it, or this or that...
From what I've seen, especially of country audiences and rap-hip-hop dance music audiences, they care about the singer and are a lot more interested in who the singer is dating, than anything about their music.

Carole King and Burt Bacharach (and Hal David)? One has a show on Broadway all about her life and career ("Beautiful"), while the other wrote every hit song by every performer ever staged or recorded that wasn't written by Carole King.
(Yeah, I know that's not what you meant. But, whatever -- King and Bacharach are the philosopher's stones of pop music. All pop alchemy begins and ends with them!)

you forgot , turn in your blue cubes , this week its red cubes consume , consume, consume!
We had a discussion around this video here a few months back, sort of interesting info. I watched it then but not again now.
If I look at modern times I think I could sub in the auto industry or the food industry or the appliances industry and not need to change much in the commentary besides the technical details as they apply to the product we are surprised to see had gotten worse while the tech for making product has advanced.
Back "then" we had product intended to be good.
Now we have product intended to be disposable.
Back then executives made a very comfortable living.
Now executives feel they need to make quadruple comfortable money and the stock market siphons off more than it injects into the economy as startup money.
So in order to satisfy the drunken stuporous greed of todays in-power market drivers, we must consume, then discard.
Making shiny garbage and marketing it aggressively fits the model perfectly.
In fairness, cars do last longer now.
But we'll see if there is a restoration movement restoring worn out 21st Century cars in 50 years!

Back in the 70s I had a holiday job in a supermarket. They played canned music on an endless loop. To avoid PRS issues, I assume, it wasn't even the 'original artists'.
After hearing a bunch of third rate performers murdering 'Blockbuster' 'Killing Me Softly' 'Paper Roses' and 'Love Train' for the tenth time that day I was ready to go postal.

Can you cite some examples? Most of what I've heard from the last two decades has been squashed to death in The Loudness Wars. I often wonder why studios have lockers full of expensive microphones when they turn out product that could have been done just as well with a raft of SM57s.

Off the top of my head? Check out Vulfpeck and its offshoot, the Fearless Flyers. Not a face over 30 in that band and they're tight as hell.
With the cost of production and distribution approaching zero, it makes no sense to look at what the corporate music industry is pushing. They're going to publish and promote what's going to sell, and most of that's going to be lowest-common-denominator crap that's written by the same half-dozen people.
There are a fistful of song-of-the-day podcasts that have introduced me to good material I'd never have heard of otherwise. While it doesn't hold the same place in my music collection as the stuff I grew up on, there's a lot of good stuff out there. The one from KEXP in Seattle is a good place to start. I don't like all of it, but if I find something new and interesting every couple of weeks, I consider myself ahead of the game.
Every kind of music sucks...to someone.
We're talking as if music isn't inherently crap. It is, you know. It always has been.
But there are brief and glorious historical conjunctions where music is partially infested by genius and the audience possesses some ability to tell the difference. In between there are vast and deep Dark Ages where unrewarded scribes try to keep something of value from fading completely.
Music is like opinion. The only 21st Century difference is that it's become far easier to subject lots of people to yours. Broadcasting and relativism.
Totally agree about Loudness wars and over-compression. And that can be a sign of poor recording technique, for sure.
But modern production has absorbed all the decades of experimentation - Dub, Minimalism, Grunge, Rock - and exploited new technology. It's way more sophisticated, and can sound amazingly good. You can certainly do more in the studio (and live) nowadays. Begs the question "What would the Beatles have done with a sampler?"
And pop production (apart from the over-compression) is often a masterclass: Britney, Beyonce, Kylie - no expense spared, state of the art studio magic.
But also Elbow, David Sylvian, Portico Quartet, Burial. A real appreciation of sound, space, depth.
Sorry, going way off topic .

 not really you hit on the point of the video ,some thing like, the over use of compression is to bring the quiet passages up to the level of the loudest parts and to prevent signal overload , then compress the whole thing down again to MP3 level , CD was always and designed to Be 16 bit 44.1 Khtz , so every thing had to be compressed to follow that format , but for high definition audio , 5.1 upto 11.1 audio mixes are 24 bit 192 Khtz and how many people carry around a 5.1 surround headset for their phone or tablet? its all in the application , similar to the release of a broadcast mix for radio is much different that the audio CD release for consumers , due to the broadcast limitations and specific compression modes .
But in the over use of compression the audio signal looses all of its dynamic range , and this is compensated by the use of familiar ,patterns, runs , from other songs that the listener is not aware of or hasnt noticed , and the listener subconscienciously like the tune but does not know why . and that was the point of the video.
you win first prize!

Even if it isn't recorded that way, radio stations are going to compress the hell out of it so they jump off the dial at their listeners. I did on-air for a commercial FM in the 1980s that played classic rock, and it was amazing how songs you knew faded out got down to five... four... three... two seconds left and were still just as loud if you were listening to what came back from the transmitter.
Calling Taylor Swift's stuff "music" is like calling McDonald's stuff "food." In a general sense, I guess it is, but it's in the familiar/mass garbage category, not the creative category. Little music -- little enough of anything -- is creative and new, or has every been. I doubt if the can or ever will change. However, I find the content of contemporary music to be really demoralizing and boring, most particularly country, rap, and hip-hop, which are genuinely bad for you.

But I think if you work at it you can find sufficient great music in 2018. I think you have to concentrate to accomplish this now. I think in 1968, almost half of the music I got to hear was quite good. Nobody has the nerve to say that about 2018.
In order for 1968 to be as bad as 2018, you'd have to have 2,000 performers as bad as Ray Stevens. And there is only one Ray Stevens (thankfully).

It's okay, if you like "unfashionable" music from decades ago. But the fact of being old doesn't necessarily makes music any more authentic or honest or whatever.
I like my share of songs from the past 100 years up to present 2018.
But I know there's also a gazillion of boring songs from 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90, 00s as well.
Ever wonder why aging white dudes suck?
IMO the decade that produced the worst popular music was the the decade I grew up in, the 80's. I blame the the technology (synths, drum machines etc.) and MTV. In the 90's it got a little better. Digital technology advanced so that we weren't listening to the same samples as much. Electronic music took huge steps forward during that time. In the 90's I also noticed that more and more bands didn't sound as good live compared to the recordings. I blame the digital recording process. You didn't need to get it right when tracking, you could tweak everything in place afterwards.
Now I think pop music is like a polished product more than any time in the past. Too much of that just sucks the life out of music. On the other hand via the internet we have waaaayyyy better access to many kinds of music we weren't aware of before. That leads to interesting stylistic fusion and collaborations, that's just not popular music any more.
Third point is that I don't think that music is as significant part of youth culture as it was before. I doesn't unite and divide anymore. The online music streams and bits are consumed more like any other consumer product.
Well, in one way or another, contemporary music always sucks. Throughout the history.

a small handfull of artists are named but not to bash , just to illustrate how they fit into the scheme of things

music today is for the kids of today. bottom line some great, some good, some wretched, what ever the genre , but the sound quality sucks because thats how the industry pops it out , MP3 is never going to sound as warm as analog , analog is never going to be as clear as digital but at 24 bit 192K digital is vibrant, however you as a consumer have no choice in the matter becuase as long as the industry manipulates what you hear the audio will be compressed to hell and all that fine recording is in the toilet .
and that kids is the video

I just assumed I didn’t like modern music because it’s not made for me.
It’s made for young people, and I ain’t young anymore.
No biggie.
It is not made for everyone, of all ages.
Same as it ever was.
Every generation drags the popular music of their youth along with them as they age.
People like what excited them when they were young (and alive).
In my youth I hated jazz, country, classical, and “disco”.
If it wasn’t guitar-wank rock, I didn’t care about it.
I “get” those styles now because I have had the luxury of the time to explore them.
Now the music I love is the music I perform at gigs.
Enjoyable thread, 24-Track. You seem to have shaken a few trees
The total acceptance of mp3 is what bugs me most. Why do we spend all those hours producing clean, detailed mixes at 24/192kHz so that the music can be squashed and mastered to a lossy (but convenient and small) format for general consumption.
We know the difference when we sit in front of our studio monitors, but does the average consumer of music know, or care ?

First:
So, "Sergeant Pepper" is just as relevant and powerful today, as it was when it was released?
To whom?
To people who thought it relevant and powerful originally back then and still do?
To a handful of millennials who have listed to it?
To critics?
I was recently asked by a young man about Stairway to Heaven. He had never heard it. So I played the recording for him. He's 25 and works as a computer programmer/developer and is a musician. I sincerely doubt that he's heard "Sergeant Pepper" or that he would consider it "relevant and powerful". He might consider it interesting or weird. I didn't much care for it 50 years ago when it came out.
Second:
To go from Dylan to Bieber or Spears or Perry is a false comparison. There were plenty of teen idols and pop stars in 1966 when Bob Dylan was on top of The Rock Pile, and they sold more singles than he did.
#1 songs in 1966:
"Lightnin' Strikes" Lou Christie
"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'" Nancy Sinatra
"Hanky Panky" Tommy James and the Shondells
"Sunshine Superman" Donovan
"Last Train to Clarksville" The Monkees
"Winchester Cathedral" The New Vaudeville Band
The Beatles made the list with Paperback Writer and We Can Work It out.
And the #1 song for the entire year...
"Ballad of the Green Berets" SSgt Barry Sadler

Come on man, what did you think was going to happen when you named a thread "Ever wonder why contemporary music sucks?". It reads more like you want to have an argument than a conversation.
My comment was also in reference to the people who talk down about entire era's of music and blame younger generations for their music "sucking". I don't think I'm going out on much of a limb by saying people who make such claims have a bit of entitlement about them, and who sits at the top of the entitlement food chain?
And who is in control of the media, radio stations, algorithms, & record labels that shoves formulaic music down everyone's throats?

The only people that cared about the negatives of mp3 compression are audiophiles. Most people don't care. In fact, most musicians don't even care. To the vast majority of listeners mp3s sounded nearly as good as a CD. The fact that you could store and share music files at all, without degradation, was a huge change for the average music consumer. World changing to me, anyway.
Back in '99 I couldn't care less about any perceived negative impacts on the music industry. I could make a home recording on my off-the-shelf PC, rip it to a CD to play on another stereo, and share a file through a computer network to someone a zillion miles away, without any degradation. All on the same computer! Whoa!
Call me slow on the uptake (I've been called worse), but I'm still kinda awed by it all.
I will even admit that I really don't hear that much of a difference between a mp3 and a CD. Even so, it sounds vastly better to me than whatever "portable" tape recorder/player solution I could afford when I was a kid in the 70s.
I'm old enough to remember Walkmans being a huge step forward in consumer music consumption. How cool it was to be able to listen to your favorite cassettes in stereo, anywhere! I'm sure there were a few who lamented the death of over the ear headphones and LPs played on huge expensive component stereo equipment. That didn't change the fact that for the average music listener, a walkman sounded vastly better than the portable solutions that came before it - the transistor radio, tape recorder/players with crappy built in speakers and 6-8 D batteries, and mono earplugs.
To me the fact that mp3 even exists is still amazing.
EDIT: As a frame of reference, it's been ~19 years since I first used a PC to record and publish a song. Well, it was ~16-17 years before that time that I got my first walkman - a cheap Sanyo knock-off.

Indeed... why would anyone assume such a thing from a thread titled "ever wonder why contemporary music sucks" leading with a video titled "The TRUTH Why Modern Music is Awful" ???
The thread and the video would be more accurate and less trolly/incendiary if it was "here are some differences between the recording/music industry of the Beatles-era and today." I for one would love to know how I am supposed to get people to stop listening to lossy .mp3's on their phone. I hate that tinny, swishy sound... but it's part of a thing now that didn't exist in the 60's. I'm willing to bet that if today's technology were around back then, the White Album would have been squashed and mangled all to heck! Yuck!
Here, I will try and summarize some of the talking points this youtuber tries to weave together into his titular conclusion:
Exposure effect is bad
loudness wars
compression is bad
timbral diversity (*yawn*)
dynamic range is good
"systematic, cold, factory-produced music" is bad
singer/songwriters vs. performing artists
computers + music = bad
milennial whoop
music industry is brainwashing you
I have heard all of that before. IMO they could each be interesting topics to talk about given an individual song as an example, which they seem to do somewhat in the video. But even then, there is usually some cherry picking involved, i.e. "The vast majority of chart-topping music in the past 20 years was written by 2 people." Well sure, that's no secret. Songwriters in the music industry have been writing songs for "performing artists" for much longer than that. So what?
To take all of this together as evidence that "Modern Music is Awful" is clearly click-bait sensationalism. Surely you could have predicted the responses from the way you titled your post?
Maybe you could take a few of these complaints about "modern music" and turn them into questions, for example, "Is it better to have more dynamic range, or to even out the peaks and valleys with compression?" "Does the use of computers in music necessarily mean that all computer-based music will sound the same?" Those kinds of conversations are the ones I enjoy participating in.

a lot of young people, who have realized, the only way to make money is music now, is to cater to the group of young people that will buy formulaic music.
IF the young people did not buy formulaic music, then the young (and old) music business controllers, would sell them something else.
As it is, the music consumption demographic map of the USA is all over the place, hopelessly fragmented, and the only demographic they can realistically depend on... is the millies who buy "formulaic music".
Even those are rapidly abandoning sales of media and are adopting streaming, so, in my opinion, they're all grasping at straws.
Personally I get sick of hearing about how the state of modern music is all because of the evil industry. Its not. Its also the droves of people that buy what you hate. They feed off each other.

Come on man, what did you think was going to happen when you named a thread "Ever wonder why contemporary music sucks?". It reads more like you want to have an argument than a conversation.
My comment was also in reference to the people who talk down about entire era's of music and blame younger generations for their music "sucking". I don't think I'm going out on much of a limb by saying people who make such claims have a bit of entitlement about them, and who sits at the top of the entitlement food chain?

LOL at the end of the video he says "Music as an art form is dying" That's a pretty contentious claim, some might even say ridiculous!  It's less of a synopsis than it is a eulogy.
I appreciate your good intentions, and that it seems like you wanted to start a conversation about the quality of popular music in general, and I can appreciate that you personally were not picking on any genre or artist. But IMO it's never a good conversation starter to begin with "Hey ever notice that X sucks so much?" The only people who want to have that conversation are people that have already made up their minds!

Can we have the annual "Rock and Roll music is dead" guitar thread now?
Rant follows.
We've moved on from 'pop music was better in days of yore' to 'recording and playback media were better in days of yore'?
Most pop music that consumers bought (rather than listened to on the radio) from the 1950s thru the 1980s was played on cheap record players, at least here in the UK.
Don't get me started on cassette tapes played on a crappy Philips portable player. My smartphone through a pair of £5 earbuds sounds better.
But we were kids. It was new and exciting. We didn't give a **** about the fidelity, just the volume. Especially if we could crank it up enough to piss off the oldies. Deep Purple's Fireball played loud on a hand-me-down Dansette was audio heaven for me and my mates in 1970.
Tell me again how this modern lossy and compressed mp3 is a dreadful medium?
I've got a mid/high level audio system now and a lot of old vinyl LPs, but listening to stuff on Spotify through my laptop's speakers doesn't bring me out in a rash.
I'm 63, but some people here make me feel 18 again. As En Vogue (they're a 'manufactured' band from the 1990s, your grandkids may remember listening to them back in 92) sang, 'free your mind'.

Most of us here may be contemporaries, but we are not contemporary to the music. Ask a kid today and they'll likely tell you, "Aerosmith sucks; I like Katy Perry."
And, in twenty years, those same kids will be dismayed at the youth who think Katy Perry sucks, because Flippy Nippers is all the rage.
The last generation always thinks the current generation's music sucks.
In the '20s, it was the flappers. In the 1940s, parents thought Glenn Miller and Benny Goodman were jungle trash that would warp their kids and turn them into mindless savages. When's the last time you heard someone speak of Harry James like he's a danger to the youth of America?
Kids always hate what their parents like and parents always think their kids are on the road to ruin. It's always been that way and it always will.
But, that's doesn't make for a very interesting Internet discussion/debate/argument, now does it?

Yes, I get and agree with what you are saying to some degree and perhaps my comment applies more so to a time in the past than the present.
I wouldn't put the blame squarely on the industry folk, the consumer plays some role as well as whatever else I'm overlooking, which I'm sure is a lot. That said I wouldn't underestimate the power of bombarding the masses with something mediocre until they grow to like it, its the basis of advertising right? Maybe its just harder to do that with music nowadays than it once was when radio ruled.
And I can't help but think that the vast majority of people who've ever complained that "today's music sucks" are really saying "I'm not up for putting in the effort to find today's talented artist that resonate with me", so it seems their relying on the bombardment of the masses to inform their opinion as well?

This discussion went awry as could be expected, but the dead horse is still twitching!
Your statement I quoted is totally and entirely true, yet we shouldn't let it diminish the fact that today's top pop music truly is much lower quality than the top pop music of the late '60s.
Sadly though, the fact that humanity is inclined to complain and bicker makes it difficult to discuss the fact that the kids really are on the road to ruin!
And a lot of the reason for this can probably be traced back to the commercialism of virtually everything, to a point where psych study groups market the worst quality with the most aggression, and have succeeded in addicting kids to 18 hour a day media consumption of effectively harmful and/ or unhealthy stuff.
Bickering about lossy formats and getting mad because 40 somethings feel attacked by 60 somethings (and vice versa) kind of helps the garbage peddlers distort children through the internet babysitter while addled parents seek solace also from the garbage peddling commercialist machine we can no longer imaging detoxing from.
Who can argue that first world society isn't hooked on commercial media dope?

this argument surfaces every single time this subject is discussed.
And every time its the same thing. "There is great music being made today; its not mainstream and you have to look harder for it".
This, in a nutshell, is the issue. there so much music out there, looking for "good" is a full-time job. In the 70s you more or less did not have to, the quality stuff was on the FM radio 24 hours a day. Depending on your definition of quality of course, but in general, the bands that have stood the test of time.
Putting in the effort is one thing. that doesnt mean you're going to find much. I read another forum where people constantly put up youtube clips of modern music, and, while that is a fantastic source of new music.... I've only bought a couple of CDs in two or three years. I did buy a handful of electronica tracks.
Its not that I'm not looking for it. Instead, I do look and much of it does not appeal to me; and that is the direct rebuttal to that same old argument always aired on these same discussions.
I really don't understand why people don't seem to grasp the idea that just because they don't personally like something, that doesn't necessarily mean that it isn't good.
There's plenty of good stuff out there that I can't stand, i.e. all heavy metal, most country, etc. That doesn't mean it isn't objectively good; it just means I don't like it.
Ariana Grande isn't my cup of tea, but when I watched the benefit concert she did last year, I couldn't deny that she had talent. And, I could certainly see why she has the legions of fans that she does.
"I don't like it, therefore it sucks" is obviously untrue, but so many people seem to live by it as a mantra. We live in a very egocentric universe when it comes to music, don't we?

Enjoyable thread, 24-Track. You seem to have shaken a few trees
The total acceptance of mp3 is what bugs me most. Why do we spend all those hours producing clean, detailed mixes at 24/192kHz so that the music can be squashed and mastered to a lossy (but convenient and small) format for general consumption.
We know the difference when we sit in front of our studio monitors, but does the average consumer of music know, or care ?Click to expand...

Ha ha that's funny but also not far enough from reality to have a hearty laugh over!
It's a lot like the circa 1940s/ '50s commercial embargo on healthy food, replacing it with food with long shelf life, so that mass production would not be hampered by the fickle consumer.
In order to make foods that could sit for weeks in warehouses and on shelves, the food industry conspired to remove the healthy parts like the germ and bran from the wheat and the peanut oil from peanut butter, replacing it with hydrogenated fat.
The refined bleached white flour has given us omentum on kids who are barely old enough to have lost their baby fat, and the hydrogenated fats have given us heart disease etc.
Now one might ask why consumers switched to the new products if they were not good?
The initial marketing movement focused on white bread being pure and good, like all things white and pure.
Hmmm, wasn't there a Civil Rights movement starting up back then, threatening to let non whites drink from the same water fountains?
Never mind all that, even boomers are too young to remember.
There was indeed resistance to white bread, as hearty home made darker breads were the preference for keeping our workers working after lunch.
"Helps build strong bodies 12 ways!" followed the "white purity is better" strategy.
Boomers certainly remember that, and millennials probably remember when the scam, was finally uncovered and stopped.

the other forum I mentioned I read, is one for audiophiles and they have endless discussions on similar topics.
My sig line over there is "Currently at the audiologist because I cant hear half the things you guys complain about".
Most often I listen in the car, and with the roadnoise... mp3s are fine.
I once did a test where I had a flac of a song in the player and then a 320k mp3 of the same song, playing back to back.
Once the car was moving, impossible to tell the difference.

While my own music consumption echoes this to some degree, it's not without some question as to why having to look for good music is so hard in the first place.
Was AOR in the 70s really that good? In comparison to what? There wasn't anything else. It was AM talk radio and oldies/country, rock/AOR, and general variety pop. That was it. What was played was what we heard, period. There was no true variety, and certainly no choice. It was all what the record companies thought would sell. Well, it did sell, because that's what they promoted.
Was it all that good? Or was it just what we knew?
You couldn't make a quality recording at home, and share it with the world. The artists "good" enough to get people to help pay for that are the ones we heard on the radio. And by good, I mean marketable, in the eyes of the labels and producers.
We know, both intuitively and scientifically, that repetition is what works. We grew to like what we heard because we heard it, repeatedly. The internet has all but destroyed that. We now have to sift through tons of music to get a gem. So much that we may not hear something enough to like it. And how do we know a gem when we hear it, anyway? We don't. So we just go back to our old tried and true stuff.... The stuff we used to hear on the radio.

IMO the decade that produced the worst popular music was the the decade I grew up in, the 80's. I blame the the technology (synths, drum machines etc.) and MTV. In the 90's it got a little better. Digital technology advanced so that we weren't listening to the same samples as much. Electronic music took huge steps forward during that time. In the 90's I also noticed that more and more bands didn't sound as good live compared to the recordings. I blame the digital recording process. You didn't need to get it right when tracking, you could tweak everything in place afterwards.
Now I think pop music is like a polished product more than any time in the past. Too much of that just sucks the life out of music. On the other hand via the internet we have waaaayyyy better access to many kinds of music we weren't aware of before. That leads to interesting stylistic fusion and collaborations, that's just not popular music any more.
Third point is that I don't think that music is as significant part of youth culture as it was before. I doesn't unite and divide anymore. The online music streams and bits are consumed more like any other consumer product.Click to expand...

"Am-F-C-G" is just a variation on C-Am-F-G (commonly referred to as "Ice Cream Changes"), the basis for bazillions of tunes, including "I've Got Rhythm", the quintessential *jazz* tune, from which we get possibly the second*** most common jazz chord changes, called "Rhythm changes". Thousands upon thousands of variations, added bridge chord changes, etc.
There really is nothing new under the sun.

I agree. But that's kinda my point. It takes effort and focus to determine if we truly like something that is not at least somewhat familiar. There wasn't a huge choice back then. But we have so much choice now our tendency is to fall back on what we are comfortable with. So the record companies have to play it safe and promote "good enough", in the sense that it's rehashed and unoriginal. Meanwhile those of us who lived through the day, have 24/7 access to all of the old stuff to keep us somewhat satisfied 'til we die.
Movies and network TV have been doing the same for years now. It's all remakes and endless sequels. Just this morning I heard an NPR report on the rapid growth of original shows on streaming networks. How is broadcast TV responding? By being even more conservative. A Murphy Brown remake? I mean, really?

but they've been doing this since day 1. Nothing new here. One of the guys in the Atlanta Rhythm Section told me once about the Classics 4 song "Spooky"... it was so successful that the suits told them, "do another one JUST LIKE THAT" and basically gave them a song called "Stormy". Just an example.
This is what the business does, has been doing since the beginning... if it sold before, do it again and again and again until it doesnt sell anymore. Now they're doing it in spades because the market for their product is shrinking and fragmenting so badly they only have really one or two demographics to shoot at. So for that reason, it seems more formulaic and calculated than ever.
I heard on Altanta's "alternative new music" radio station last night, a new modern band doing something that sounded EXACTLY like ACDC at times. Of course without the brilliant guitar solo. Most modern bands on the radio dont have that anymore.

“The music business is a cruel and shallow money trench, a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free, and good men die like dogs. There's also a negative side.” - Hunter S. Thompson
While I agree with much of the observations about the music industry formally pushing cheapened music product, I think there are factors that are not the music industry's fault, or even the fault of lowering standards of the masses.
With widespread use of X and the rise of the rave came industrial and DJ "music".
I'm not sure of a timeline but it seems that all those high rave attendees were more interested in rubbing up against each other than in "seeing bands", and chose raves and club scene sound over artists performing traditional music.
During all this we also had Hip Hop and Rap splintering off the listening audience.
At around the same time frame we got college educated guitar players shredding, dominating the club music scene in many cities, making guitar band music more homogeneous and less interesting, except to guitar students and guitar god worshipping teenage/ 20 something boys.
At some point the pre-teen fantasy about pre-teen pop stars also took a bit of marketshare, and this seemed to be music made by producers rather than bands, where there was no actual artist involved.
This is pretty vague but a good chunk of the market went to the pre pubescent pop star and audience, possible partly because of the large portion of the drinking age market moving to rave/ industrial/ DJ where there was (I'm guessing) no real music biz money being made.
All these things played some role without being any sinister conspiracy.
More like a perfect storm bringing an end to the domination of pop music by cool guitar bands.

ok, no argument with all of that
another thing that ended the dominance of guitar music is that it became ubiquitous
By the early 2000s there was a really good guitar player on every street in america. Supply and demand. There are so many now that its no longer a mystery, or an art.
In the 70s guitar heros were lauded, in part because it was extremely difficult to learn how to do what they did, and that reason among others made them special, and also very alluring to... well you know.
These days, its all been done many years ago, there are youtube tutorials explaining every trick any guitar hero ever did, slowed down for the beginner; the internet became the worlds guitar teacher and that cats out of the bag now.
every teenage girl has a brother, a father, or an uncle, who is a good guitar player. Theres no mystery in it anymore. 70s rock is now DAD ROCK and good guitar players are for the most part, ho hum.
Its not that there are no young people playing guitar or being in guitar bands. Sure there are. But it doesnt dominate now.
Even so, when I listen to "guitar bands" on the alternative new music station here... theres almost never a great guitar solo lead section. That must be the ultimate sig of Dad Rock.
Good music ≠ only guitar bands.
Yeah I listen to the local alt rock station and only change it if a tune is just totally unbearable to listen to. Also change it when the unbearable ad talk comes on.
Like I think it was you @Wrong-Note Rod that said, there is good music being made but I'm not buying albums any more, or in my case not even downloading the new stuff.
While I agree about the mystery of great guitar playing being gone, I'm not sure that should really kill off guitar music or bands that feature guitar and bass.
The violin family, piano, woodwinds and brass still rule, so why not guitars in popular music for young people?
I think that all I said about the perfect storm of multiple scenarios involved in dumbing down pop music and pushing the guitar way toward the back burner; are not the real core reason for the biggest pop "sucking".
IMO it is the youth addiction to mobile and stationary-gaming devices sucking the life out of so many young people.

True of course!
Here the discussion seems to stem from music that had been dominated by bands with guitars in them over the decades in question.
And we can identify the guitar becoming less attractive as it became more technically approached and often less musical, so not attractive to mixed crowds.
When pop music exploded in the '60s the guitar was everywhere, kids could learn to play a few basic chords and sing the songs on the radio at the beach, in coffee houses, at parties, in the garage, and then in their own bands.
The guitar planted a seed that brought music making to the uneducated masses, music that required no music stand or director.
It was a rush of freedom in an era when youth was rejecting the parents values more strongly than in most past generations, more in harmony, and since Woody and Pete, the revolution was happening with guitars in hand.
Well, the revolution is over!
Now the masses pay Amazon a fee to get free shipping on overpriced low quality disposable goods, and allow full time data mining surveillance in their homes to serve big business interests with glee!
Look at how a lot of folks drive now. Impatience/lack of attention span, adrenaline rush-seeking, aggressiveness, distractedness, less spatial awareness, less regard for consequences or life.
There's more to it than just technology and generational divide.
The music that a bizarre physiology consumes and creates can't help but reflect a diet of rabbit-holes and selfism.
i think when you are discussing "uncontemporary" or 60s-70s classic rock stuff, you're more or less discussing guitar bands. Note more or less.
many of these discussion boil down to modern rock/pop vs classic rock.
Ever wonder why contemporary music sucks?
No. I never generalize.

AFAIK we stopped playing Sweet Home Alabama a few pages back and are just jamming on a vamp.
Nobody's really still singing those lyrics unless returning from a long toilet hug in the restroom!
Hell I'm not even sure if it was SHA or Southern Man, but does it really matter on the internet?

Politics and religion!
Most pop is written for people who like music.
Most other forms are written for people who love music
@notmyusualuserid - I was waiting for someone to make that point about the medium. As a kid who grew up taping songs off the radio (for personal use), first with a separate cassette player and all that entailed (read, **** quality, even before the cassette tape started to stretch), or I left it sitting on the car dash in the sun and it melted, etc., then with a tuner and receiver with BUILT IN cassette recorder, where the tapes did sound slightly better, until they started to stretch and warble, I find this whole "lossless e-files suck" line of reasoning amusing. One of my friends has an old Victrola that he pops Christmas records on every year for their annual holiday party. I think it even has tubes. Wanna guess if he's doing that for the high sound quality?

ok, no argument with all of that
another thing that ended the dominance of guitar music is that it became ubiquitous
By the early 2000s there was a really good guitar player on every street in america. Supply and demand. There are so many now that its no longer a mystery, or an art.
In the 70s guitar heros were lauded, in part because it was extremely difficult to learn how to do what they did, and that reason among others made them special, and also very alluring to... well you know.
These days, its all been done many years ago, there are youtube tutorials explaining every trick any guitar hero ever did, slowed down for the beginner; the internet became the worlds guitar teacher and that cats out of the bag now.
every teenage girl has a brother, a father, or an uncle, who is a good guitar player. Theres no mystery in it anymore. 70s rock is now DAD ROCK and good guitar players are for the most part, ho hum.
Its not that there are no young people playing guitar or being in guitar bands. Sure there are. But it doesnt dominate now.
Even so, when I listen to "guitar bands" on the alternative new music station here... theres almost never a great guitar solo lead section. That must be the ultimate sig of Dad Rock.Click to expand...
Your post is very Guitar-Centric, and I suppose that's understandable, seeing as we're on a Telecaster board. I think if you consider the recent history of Pop music, say from the end of the Big Band era (1948?) to the present, only a potion of those hits were guitar-driven songs. While Elvis was strumming away on a Gibson acoustic, Frank Sinatra and Pat Boone were selling a ton of records, too. Listen to all the Motown music that sold through the 60s and 70s. While the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix were redefining Rock, there were hundreds of R&B hits with only the occasional guitar hook (My Girl ... Baby, Can I Change My Mind?) I play guitar for a living, so my ear is cocked toward paying attention to guitarists and guitar bands. Still, even as guitars rocked through the 70s, groups like Three Dog Night made millions on the basis of well written tunes sung by good vocalists.
My point is, I'm not aware of the electric guitar being as ubiquitous and as dominating through the modern era of Pop music as that image has been represented

I watched that video two nights ago and it makes a lot of sense. repietition= familiarity.
Whoas -Hmmn. The Millennial whoop. God I yearn for Linda Ronstadt's single note semi-breves and Roy Orbison' s voice. Whole notes suspended over some bars with no warbling.
Lyrics are not like the complexity of early Springsteen songs either.
Compression- yep and exposure for more familiarity.
Oh and the big one- MONEY. to make sales you need lots of investment.
I like the speakers point that years ago musicians had to be " bloody talented" and not sloppy.
We'd buy records and then repetition would see us seeking out the nuances in music.
Like him, my head is stuck back about 50 years ago in the 60s and 70s. But thet's just me.
The analysis of 500,000 songs ( if true) suggests a great deal of support for this view- music is crappier now, moreso than ever, and, has in fact, been declining for decades.
No doubt I'll get c... over my comments and agreement with this man's views. But it is a free world and you and I are entitled to our opinions.
P.S Interesting pronounciation of TIMBRE a French word that varies all over in pronounciation.Click to expand...
Thank you for summarizing this so I don’t have to. The biggest points were the compression, the lyrics and the unwillingness to take risks.

The Wizard Of Oz starring Shirley Temple as Dorothy
Hmm, Shirley Temple as Dorothy. Singing Sonewhere Over The Rainbow,,,
At the time of casting it was always Shirley Temple they saw as Dorothy, in fact it was going to happen when big biz arguing changed the course and Judy Garland got the role.
I can't think of anyone that could replace Garland in that movie. Ditto to the scarecrow, tin man and cowardly lyon.
I don't know the details of this story. Maybe someone will chime in with the details?
I have no details of the history but that movie is as perfect as we can hope for in my opinion. I am a fan

I don't know anything about the Shirley Temple/Judy Garland dustup, but I do know a munchkin did NOT hang himself and get included in the movie. https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hanging-munchkin/
On a side note, Munchkin Suicide would either be a really great or really bad band name, depending on the band.
Buddy Ebson was supposed to be the Tin Man, but he was highly allergic to the silver makeup. They wanted a singer who could dance for Dorothy, and they were thinking of Judy Garland, but thought she was already too old for the role, since Dorothy was supposed to be around 12. They thought of Shirely Temple next, but decided the role required a better singer than dancer, and that Temple didn't really have the voice.

I think Buddy Ebsen would have been good in the role of the Tin Man. He did participate in the recording of the song We're Off To See The Wizard sung by Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion so his voice can actually be heard in the movie.
They should’ve let Toto’sDad make the call...father knows best
I've read some truly awful things the producers did to Garland during the filming.
They thought she was too chunky, and gave her diet pills as well as encouraged her to smoke cigarettes.
Lauren Bacall recalled: “From childhood Judy was placed on drugs – to lose weight or to go to sleep or to wake up. And once you get hooked on pills... it obviously affected her.”Click to expand...
Judy Garland was 16 when she won the role of Dorothy in the MGM musical in 1938 and it was to mark both the beginning and the end of her career. The insecure teenager was by that time addicted to barbiturates and amphetamines and was on the road to alcoholism. In addition, she was routinely molested by older men including studio chiefs who considered her little more than their “property”.
While I am sure that Andrew Lloyd Webber is a demanding taskmaster, he would never send spies to the winner’s home to ensure that she kept to a steady diet of coffee, cigarettes and chicken soup, a humiliation endured by Garland for 17 years at MGM.Click to expand...
Lots of "almost-was" in the casting of iconic movies.
I still can't see John Wayne in Gunsmoke, but it might have happened.
I really think it's all about our conditioning, having seen all these movies so many times that we can't imagine else in those roles.

Absolutely NOTHING to do with the Garland/Temple aspect of your post, but my first foray into musical theater was as a Munchkin in the 1960 Casa Manana production of Wizard of Oz. Began my "career" that lasted about four years of summer stock musicals. I was all of nine years old.....
Can anyone recommend a good Judy Garland biography?

Iconic, that's Judy Garland singing Somewhere Over The Rainbow. The round warm tone of her voice timbre, it was as beautiful as voice and song gets. Temple would not have been capable of pulling it off.
But Temple took the loss well and "comforted" her "stage" mom with a positive outlook while silently crying in bed at night about losing the role of a lifetime. At least that's the story I heard.
The problem was and still is extremely pushy stage moms that push their kids too hard and vicariously live in the shadows.
If they remade The Wizard of Oz today, I'm sure there would be a place in it for this guy.

They had her and Micky Rooney jacked up on speed for years when they were kids.
MGM was making the movie. Producers wanted Shirley Temple for the role of Dorothy, but Temple was the property of 20th Century Fox, and they wouldn't loan her to a rival studio. Garland was under contract at MGM, so the part thankfully fell to her. Initially, Judy was dressed with a blonde wig, perhaps to have her appear more Shirley Temple-like:

Nice! I must have missed that one. To the googles!
I’ve always thought a remake would be cool if the scenes in Oz were shot in 3D - and the scenes set in Kansas were two dimensional. Kind of like the color v. black and white of the original. But... I really can’t imagine a remake being as good as the original.
I’ve never watched it with the Pink Floyd album playing, but I’ll get around to that some day.
On Wisconsin Public Radio i just heard an interview with the author of "Finding Dorothy" - a historical novel about Maude Baum, Frank's wife. It sounded interesting and is now on my reading list.

Best ones are by David Shipman and Gerald Clarke. I can't remember which I liked better.
Gaylyn Studler wrote some observations about Shirley Temple in 'Precocious Charms' which could lead one to believe that a Wizard of Oz with her could have been an interesting psychosexual adventure. But she was a hot property at Fox and probably would have bust the budget anyway. They paid Judy peanut. She made more than Toto the dog but she was low man on the pay totem.
Does anyone remember Judy Garland's variety show on television? It was actually pretty cool, but I don't think it lasted very long.
Judy and Liza:
It lasted 26 episodes from 1963-64. If you were a fan, the opening of the first show was electric. Several years ago Sid Luft (I think) arranged for a DVD release of all the shows which were in fantastic condition.
There was a fella on TCM telling a story. His parent(s) was an actor and Judy and many others would visit and they would stay up all night singing and dancing and playing.
Now I know how she did it.
But please, please don't re-make this movie. I wish Hollywood could do more original plots instead of just adding cgi to an old idea. And stuff like that.

I had to say goodbye to the best cat ever.
Munchie. The most un-cat like cat I've ever seen. All cats seem to have their own personalities but Munchie was the most unique cat I've ever come across. He was also the best behaved cat I've ever seen. Never really got into trouble. He was a sweetie. Just about every night for almost 12 years he would sit and suckle in my lap. He always had to wear himself out suckling before he could get comfy and pass out in my lap. He was just plain cool. He used to walk with me through the woods. Traveled across the country with me. He once ate cheetos out of my mouth. Eww. Ate whipped cream off my nose. Ate catnip that I weaved between my girlfriend's toes. He loved cheetos, chips and white cheddar popcorn. I could go on and on. He was my baby boy. There was never any question who his person was. Today he layed in my lap one last time as he was put down. I buried him with the only cat toy he ever played with, his little mouse, his favorite soft brown blanket and a handful of cheetos. I love you Munchie and I'll never, ever forget you.
I'm sorry that he had to go. Sometimes pets really, really connect with us and it's clear that Munchie was a special dude.
We've had cats and dogs together, and all are, or have been, real characters and brought joy to our lives. However, one cat we call an "empath" because she's so emotionally connected to my wife and I that if either of us has any distress, she is right there in our face fixated on making us feel better. It's really eerie how she can pick up on anything - maybe the change in the timbre of our voice that we can't even detect, or maybe a smell. But there she is ... and she's so incredibly gentle that there's not a thing you could do to make her swipe at you. You can decide to massage her toes and her claws will retract and she'll purr like a turbo-charged V8, or hold her head between your palms in a ball to massage it and she loves it. When her time comes we will be crushed.
I think Munchie must have been like that for you. As we've been holed-up for the last 6-8 weeks, I think we've all been even more connected to our pets. Sorry for your loss.
I’m truly sorry for your loss.
I’m a cat lover, too.
My two girls are middle aged, but are still healthy, so far.
I dread the time when their health falters.
They are great, comforting therapists!
Perhaps in awhile you may adopt again?

I am sincerely sorry for your loss. Animals seem to get further under our skin, than some people do, it's hard, hard, hard to turn them loose.
Cat life....
sorry for your loss.
I'm sorry for your loss. It sounds like you gave him a wonderful and happy life.
Sorry about your good buddy, man. That is a tough one.
My guy of 17 years is really declining, I'm trying to not think about the inevitable.
What a beautiful tribute to Munchie.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
oh Munchie - thank you for your service.
...these cats that come into our lives and make our days a little better...
It's been nearly three years, and we refer to our missing bed partner nearly every night - still missing Minnie.
Great pic - sounds like a great little dude.
Peace - Deeve
RIP Munchie... He was lucky to have such a good human, too.
I’m glad you both found your soulmate. Animals are wonderful, especially when they remind us that wear are animals too.
My thoughts for your loss.
Sad news. So sorry for your loss.
RIP Munchie
I'm sad for you - I have been there and it was a real wrench to let the little guy go...
I have not had a pet since, but I hope you can find a place in your life for another little furry buddy
All my thoughts and prayers, gobi_grey.
I know how it is to lose your best buddy.
Cats are really cool creatures. I miss our two almost daily
Munchie had a great life and is no longer in any pain or discomfort
Positive thoughts to you and RIP Munchie
Sorry for your loss. Sounds like a really special cat.
Sorry man

Cats rule my world. I’ve been a Cat Man my entire life.
No regrets. Very sorry for Your loss of Munchie.

I am sorry for your loss. I had to bury Xena d'Katt 3 weeks ago. I placed her body with her favorite toy in a shoe box she loved to lay on and planted her on some recently reforested timber land overlooking the town on the way home from "the big ride". My own yard is too rocky to dig in. The image was taken at the vet's office just before she was euthanized.
Love people that are in love with their animals and so sorry for your loss. So, &*$*(ing hard. My most amazing dog died last summer and I still get tears in my eyes just writing this. Fun fun memories sad sad to lose. Hope you find another when you're ready.
I've been there and I feel for you. Posts like yours make me appreciate Barry my current cat chum even more.
Sorry about Munchie. Best wishes
Sorry for the loss of your dear friend and companion.
I’m so sorry. Hang in there buddy.
Sorry for your loss, Gobi. RIP Munchie!
that's a heartbreaker sir. sounds like you provided a good and safe life for him and you should be proud of that.

I'm sorry gobi. I totally understand what you're going through, as I've had many pets throughout my life, mostly cats. It never is easy.
You gave him a good life.

So very sorry for your loss. It hurts so when we lose our little frinds. I hope he meets my Mooch and my Mosby on the other side of the Rainbow Bridge and that they become best burddies.
Sorry for Your loss.When your ready you will come across your next one.
I am so sorry for your loss.
I've been there, too. Sorry for your loss.
I’ve been through the pain you’re going through now. You did everything you could to give him a good life filled with love. I’m sorry for your loss.

So sorry.
Taking our first and only pet to the vet on that last day, was the hardest thing I ever had to do.
I’m so sorry Gobi.
I also had a cat named Munchie and he was almost human in his behavioral complexity. I was sad when he had to go. Sorry for your loss.
R.I.P. dear Munchie .
so sorry for the loss of your Munchie. your tribute says it all.
those of us who love our little companions as you do know exactly what you're feeling.
the bigger the place they have in our lives the bigger the hole that's left when we lose them.
several years ago I read an interview with Rachel Maddow. there was a whole series of questions but one of the last was "if you could what would you change about your family?"
her response was "Dogs would live forever."
whether it be a pup, or cat the feeling is just the same.
So sorry man. Cat's were my best friends for 35 years. My last one was a dog in a cat body too.
I'm so sorry gobi-grey. RIP Munchie, you were the best boy.
I'm so sorry for your loss. I've gone through the same thing many times and it's always hard.
Awww. I was just thinking about my cats and how they're getting a bit on in the years and then 2 seconds later I opened this. Mine definitely have their little personalities or I guess it would be "catalities". They do also develop habits and patterns that are felt deeply in their absence.
So very sorry. It can be extremely painful to lose a deeply loved pet/family member. My deepest sympathy.
I'm so so sorry. We lost the guy in my avatar, Hopper, on Christmas Day in 2018. Not sure I'll ever really get over it. He was the best dude. He was totally mellow and loved everybody and everybody loved him.
We got a new guy last summer. He's the total opposite; completely and totally insane. I think it's a good thing that he's so different, because no cat would ever compare to Hopper.
So sorry for your loss. Loving animals is so easy, we just don't get to love them long enough.
I feel ya!
This is Burt. Likewise, the best cat I ever had hands down. A lover but also just total stud hunter.
This was taken on his last day. He was skin and bones due to cancer but STILL went out and snapped up this juicy gopher.
Burt died on the porch step that night.
Animals are so much better at dying than people.

Munchie. The most un-cat like cat I've ever seen. All cats seem to have their own personalities but Munchie was the most unique cat I've ever come across. He was also the best behaved cat I've ever seen. Never really got into trouble. He was a sweetie. Just about every night for almost 12 years he would sit and suckle in my lap. He always had to wear himself out suckling before he could get comfy and pass out in my lap. He was just plain cool. He used to walk with me through the woods. Traveled across the country with me. He once ate cheetos out of my mouth. Eww. Ate whipped cream off my nose. Ate catnip that I weaved between my girlfriend's toes. He loved cheetos, chips and white cheddar popcorn. I could go on and on. He was my baby boy. There was never any question who his person was. Today he layed in my lap one last time as he was put down. I buried him with the only cat toy he ever played with, his little mouse, his favorite soft brown blanket and a handful of cheetos. I love you Munchie and I'll never, ever forget you.

Sorry for your loss. I was raised with dogs and cats, and through much of my life, childhood and adult years, I've had both. Up until 3-1/2 years ago, the dogs were primarily outdoors and the cats indoors. Now I have a Bocker Speagle (Beagle/Cocker Spaniel mix) coexisting with two rescue cats. The cats I have presently are Celeste (Siamese/tabby mix) and Annie (gray & white)...
I'm really fond of both of these cats, but they both are "catty," each in their own way. Displays and/or acceptance of affection must always be strictly on their own terms. And they each have different standards and tolerance levels.
But one of their predecessors was different: Rocky. He died in January of 2009, about a year and a half before Celeste and Annie came along. Rocky came to us--really, to me--Thanksgiving Day, 1994. Two of my children, then in their teens, were visiting a friend in an apartment complex across town. Our Thanksgiving days are usually not overly cold down here in south Texas, but it was cold that year.
As they were visiting their friend, my kids found a gray tabby kitten that had been abandoned. He was a runt, and a polydactyl. He had extra "digits" on each of his forepaws, and in between his "thumb and forefinger" was a claw not attached to a digit, but growing out in between them. These didn't retract, so I jokingly referred to him as our little cheetah. He clicked whenever he walked across our hardwood floors. And whenever he would fold up his forepaws in front of his body, as cats are wont to do, those front paws with their extra digits made him look like he was wearing boxing gloves, hence the name "Rocky." He was cold and hungry and my kids couldn't resist bringing him home.
But we already had 3 indoor cats, and the kids knew I wouldn't want a 4th, so my son, 18 at the time, kept him in his room, our garage turned apartment. It was a day or two later that they brought him inside and introduced him to me. And I reacted just like they figured I would: "We're not keeping that kitten!" At that point, my son held him up by his front legs, showing the kitten's big mitts, and exclaimed, "But he's got thumbs!" I agreed that he was cute, but was undaunted. I picked up the phone and called a friend to see if he would be interested in adopting a cat. My friend wasn't home. I sat there with phone in hand, trying to think of someone else to call. Rocky must have sensed his impending fate, so he took matters into his own...um, paws.
Rocky clicked his way across the floor of our living room, reached up to my blue jeans with those impressive forepaws of his, and proceeded to climb his way up to me. He climbed up my leg, past my lap and belly, and kept going until he burrowed his way underneath my long gray beard. (I guess he thought I was a gray tabby, too.) There he settled down, curled up his paws in front of himself, and just turned on his motors. I mean that little guy was purring loud enough for the whole room to hear! I put the phone down. I knew then and there that I had just been adopted.
As for Rocky's temperament and behavior, it was very much like your Munchie. He spent most of his life attached to me. Even before I retired, I worked a lot from home. As I sat at my desktop computer, he would crawl up into my lap, set his rear haunches down between my legs and fold his forepaws in front of him on my thigh. He would stay like that for hours if I didn't move. Sometimes he would reposition in such a way so as to get between me and my computer's keyboard.
And when I would get up to go to the toilet, it was common for Rocky to position himself outside the bathroom door and mournfully meow for my return. At night, he would curl up at my feet or by my side. In the winter, he would crawl under the covers, go past my chest and then do a turnaround and lay down on top of my beard.
Except for the first few weeks of his life, he lived all of his 15 years with me. He had respiratory problems all his life. Shortly after he chose us, we took him to the vet and he was diagnosed with pneumonia, no doubt contracted from his days of exposure. We got him through that, but thereafter he was susceptible to respiratory problems. On January 25, 2009, he breathed his last, as I held him in my arms. Even now, 11+ years later, I get a stinging in my eyes and a tightness in my chest just writing about/reliving his demise.
I'm sorry to have gone on so much about Rocky when this thread is about you and your loss of Munchie. My only excuse, if it helps, is I believe I can very much relate to what you're going through right now.
He is in the Happy Hunting Ground with Cheetos and his comfy blanket. He loves you and that will never change.
Sorry to hear this. Sorry to everyone who is posting about their cats as well.
I've been there. It's not easy. Makes me hug my living cats a little tighter tonight. It's unfair how short of time they get.
I totally understand how you are feeling, Brother.
You were tightly bonded with Munchie and he was a sweet guy. We lost our 11 year old Bombay, Panther last November. Still kills me to think of that last trip to the vet. It's one of worst days of my life for sure.
It takes time to recover.....RIP Munchie. You were definitely loved!
I'm sorry for your loss and the pain.
That's awful,,,, my condolences. RM
RIP, Munchie.
Tell Snap when you see him that I expect him to meet me on the Rainbow Bridge.
I'm so sorry.

So sorry for your loss. We love our little runt (9 lbs) of the litter, Mr Tuna. If the alarm doesn’t go off he will gentle pat you on the cheek to wake up. He says “please” by raising his left paw and says “thank you” with a short meow, he can say please, lay down and roll over on-command. He’s a guard cat, growls at unknown folks/critters in the yard, chases out squirrels, pigeons, bats, kills mice and big spiders. Can open doors and let himself in and out of the house. He’s lets you know when his food is low (free feeder). When doing yard/garden projects he will sit in the shade and supervise us. Gatherings at the house, he will go around and meet everyone. He waits for the Mrs and I when we come home and tends to heard us off to bed at night. Turkey and salmon are his favorite and if Mrs is having cereal for her breakfast, he will hop up on a kitchen chair and sit patiently for her to finish for a sip of milk from her spoon. And if anybody is feeling poorly (even the 45# dog) he is aware and let one of us know. Mr Tuna is just one of the family (even though our 3 kids are grown and out of the house). Our middle son born, in the year of the cat…when he is off the ship (merchant mariner) and not traveling, Mr Tuna loves to hang out in the “Tiger Club”.
RIP Munchie
It's the very worst thing, about sharing your life with animals. I'm with ya.....
Ah, sorry, man. It's a terrible loss.
Yet how wonderful to have had an animal like that in your life. Thanks for the stories.
I worry about people who never have the chance to love an animal like that.
My sympathies. We lost two cats within 6 months of each other that had been with us for 10 years. One died of cancer, one died of kidney failure. It sucks.
So sorry to hear of your loss.
I recently put our dog down. My 1st dog I really had. It’s never easy, they are so much a part of the family.
Can you sing with vibrato and straight tone (non-vibrato) ?
First of all - everybody can sing so don't say that.
It might sound like mouth flatulence or it might sound like Bobby Blue Bland but it's all singing and we all can do it.
But when you do - do you have a natural vibrato that you can turn on and off or is it always (or never ) there ?
Famous examples of either would be Joan Baez (who, for the record, I like a great deal) who seemingly can't turn her vibrato off and how about Dan Tyminski singing "Man Of Constant Sorrow" for straight tone (very mountain) singing.
I can switch mine on or off but it's useless as I don't sing in my or any band, so it's just one more thing squandered/wasted...

As the owner of a singing voice/capability that makes mouth flatulence shield it's ears (think of what I do as sharting to take the flatulence thing a little farther), I don't think there's any way to differentiate between my normal noises and what might technically be considered vibrato. I'm inclined to say it's never there, but I'm also inclined to say I can't sing. At all. And you're obviously not buying that notion, so I'm not sure what to tell you about the finer points of what I can't do vocally. But what I can't do is a WHOLE lot more impressive than what I can...
I can do Fender amp-style vibrato as opposed to the kind that oscillates in pitch. Kind of like Neil Young does.
There's a lady at the little folk group I play at who can't not sing with vibrato. It gets a bit much when it's on all the time but apparently she had some medical condition that meant she can only sing that way.
^^^^ And sometimes it's not in time with the music ?
I've run into that before.
Can't turn it on and off, vibrato is just there when I sing. I wasn't even aware of it, until someone a long time ago asked me how I did that. I don't sound like a guy who's juggling his Adam's apple, it's always there, just not intrusive.
I do not have natural vibrato, if that is a thing. I have to do it intentionally. If it happens without me thinking, I believe it is out of habit.
Alas, though I sing a lot, I have no vocal "chops".
Limited range, no vibrato, no real power.
My pitch and articulation are OK, and have improved in the last few years.
I sing a ton of harmony.
I work with/for a lot of lady bandleaders, so I am well versed in singing 3rds and 5ths below them.
I am very much a baritone.
Singing is a joy!

My mom (Daddy left home when I was three) taught me how to use my diaphragm when singing. When I do that I get a mild vibrato on notes that hold long enough for it to get going.

I can get a little vibrato, barely, on higher notes, if I try hard. It's easier falsetto. Because I don't like the sound of my voice high, I always sing low and straight.
I can do either, but mostly I forget to work the vibrato unless I'm just shower singing. I have about a two octave useful non-falsetto range (all the notes in a basic G chord) and some ok power if I focus. Falsetto needs a ton of work, but the main thing is starting on pitch and also staying on pitch when I jack up the volume. The fact that I can do some singing has been the most surprising thing I've ever learned about music, it took until my mid-40s before I ever once sang in public.
Usually I sing with some vibrato when singing solo vocals, but if I'm singing harmonies with others, it's best if everybody sings straight.
I have been working on developing vocal vibrato for 40 years, with little to no effect. Is there a pedal for that?
Much harder for me to sing without vibrato on low notes. Almost impossible.
A trained singer can do both.
I used to think that people couldn't help it. Like the church lady who covers 3 full steps in her modulation range. Now I know it's a choice. She's doing it on purpose! So I've been working on my church-lady-3-whole-step vibrato ever since.
I once fell in with some barbershop singers. Vibrato to them is almost a cardinal sin. They sing straight and perfect. Their music is arranged so that 4 singers can make more than 4 notes. The overtones and beat frequencies are absolutely stunning. For 10 minutes, then your get sick of the cheesy smiles and arm-oustretching and endless tags and ask them to stop. (They have a code of conduct that won't allow them to sing unless everyone present wishes to hear it).
Personally, I sing like I play guitar: with a crappy vibrato that shows up when least expected but is hard to summon when it is appropriate. (Unless it's the church lady vibrato - I got that on tap at all times.)
Unfortunately, my voice is wimpy with no natural vibrato. I get less dirty looks when I just sing harmonies but usually there's no one around to carry the melody so I have to go it alone. I have my moments when I can force out some modulation if I really try.
And as much as I agree that everyone can sing (to some degree) there are folks who were born with physically superior pipes that allow them to create very pleasant tone and timbre with no effort whatsoever.
I love/hate those people...
I sing a lot. I'm not great, but people don't cringe.
I can control vibrato with little or no effort, but I think that's an over-used vocal affectation, and try to use it sparingly.
My range decreased quite a bit due to damage that occurred during a neck surgery c. 2006. Lost my falsetto completely, and took a few tones off the high end...so I embraced my low baritone range and use what I have left over.
The "tell" of a good singer to me is one that can sing one long clear note without any vibrato and stay on pitch. It's far harder than singing with vibrato all the time. Not to mention more pleasant! Not that I dont like vibrato in the right place and not over used. Using it a lot does hide pitchiness though!
I developed vibrato years ago, and continued working on it as a voice major in college. Yes, I can "turn it off" when I want to, but most trained singers begin a "held" note straight, and then bring in their vibrato. As much as I like people like Joan Baez, her CONSTANT, fast vibrato irritates me. The only time I sing completely vibrato-less is when doing things like traditional, Celtic-type songs. They just call for a "flat", (not in pitch) tone, almost non-inflected. It also helps add a certain variety to your performances, so that every song doesn't sound just the same.
Yes I can.
I just love these threads that force me to think about something I never thought too deeply about before. I just noticed that I had vibrato one day and figured, OK, good for me. I use it for sustained notes. A coach on The Voice would say I'm a little pitchy and the vibrato hides that defect a little. I never thought about whether I was varying pitch or volume, but it's probably pitch. I held a couple of notes as I was writing this and with my hand over my diaphragm, pressure was pretty consistent. I guess I can turn it on or off, but I've naturally come to use it for sustained notes; half notes and longer. As I think about it, the warble is a little on the fast side but it beats singing out of tune.
Wife does naturally....first time I heard it I said how you do that?...do what?....I don't know.
trained here, can do both, started as a straight tone singer and gradually developed vibrato
three ways to vibrato: throat only, throat and diaphragm, diaphragm only -- like a 3 way switch
throat only is goaty, diaphragm only is like a volume swell
I know opera singers who say it comes as a natural consequence of good singing technique, but they're singers, so what do they know
lol
from my pov, I'd just say you can try exaggerating the effect, like sing as if you were parodying opera, and then figure out what you're doing and refine it, make it subtler
I've found over time that bringing vibrato to the end of a phrase does feel like a relaxation in the throat, but blending in diaphragm adds richness and helps you sing better anyway
maybe some vocal coach can chime in
I can turn it off and on. Been able to as long as I can remember.
The master of using vibrato correctly and in the correct places is Elvis.
Heavy vibrato is how people who can't sing (evangelist preachers from my experience) can actually carry a tune. If the vibrato is wide enough, you'll hit your target pitch easily... plus about 3 whole steps on either side of it!!!
I can sing with or without vibrato and pretty much got into singing as a kid, so have no recollection of how I learned.
At some point learning to play sax I read that it's harder to hold a steady note than one with vibrato, and when I tried it I understood why.
I'd agree that vibrato covers up a lot of flaws, and it doesn't hurt that it generally sounds cool.
But I set out to learn to sound "good" without vibrato, and now maybe use it less.
While I'm self conscious about hearing my voice on a recording, I have noticed that I might have over used vibrato without really considering how it fit overall, like "does this part sound better with vibrato or without?' wasn't really a part of my thought process.
Same sort of thing with recording anything really, too much reverb or delay on guitar, overly dramatic vocals, drums with too much snare rattle or not enough damping on the heads etc etc.
BTW I do indeed love Joan Baez!
She can do anything she wants with her voice.
Really, every note I've played on every instrument has been an expression of frustration over not being able to sing for very long before my voice starts to break down and crack up.

The Roches were consistent in using no vibrato. It's a bit disconcerting to many folks because it's unusually straightforward and unadorned. They did this in 3-part harmony and that's tough to pull off: everybody has to be right on the money.
To clarify the terms... vibrato is change in pitch and tremolo is change in volume. Chrissie Hynde is a good example of singing with tremolo.

First singer I think of when I hear "tremolo" is Buffy Sainte Marie.
I have a natural vibrato that comes without thinking about it, but I can turn it off. I have to choose to not use it otherwise the vibrato happens. What I find is harder is not turning it off, but varying the speed of the vibrato. That really requires me to think about what I am doing.

OK so thinking about it and listening I guess I add trem and not really vibrato.
Maybe a bit of pitch change, and I can force a warbling pitch but it sounds like hell.
Best kept to pitch drop and return, no pitch raising please!
But I listened to some Joan Baez on youtube and I'd say she's doing more trem than vibrato, so maybe the OP is wrong too?
Or maybe I'm just not listening close enough right now being distracted by other stuff.
Maybe when a singer adds true vibrato pitch change they also add some trem to the warble. More trem than vibrato sounds better IMO.
I'd be interested to listen to some youtubes of true vibrato vocals if posted here.

I'd call this vibrato because I hear the pitch change.
And here's "straight" singing...no pitch change. Interesting how intimate it makes the song sound-really draws my ear in.
One type of composition that I never found worth listening to is vocals singing melody only with multiple voices singing the exact same notes. These types of songs typically and characteristically use no vibrato.
I do both, but the vibrato only comes out when I'm on a roll. If I feel good when singing, I can bring it on as thick as I want, but sometimes it is just not available. It's like the vibrato is taking the day off or something. When I can hit the notes correctly and have vibrato, it is wonderful ... but very fleeting and rare.
BTW, there are times when the vibrato comes out and I don't want it. Any ideas for solving that? My wife, the bass player's suggestion is to stick with instrumentals.

I don't know what sounded like tremolo in that, but I think that is one of the hippiest things I've ever heard. I really like to hear Melanie Safka sing. I like her song "Someday I'll Be A Farmer" and others too.
What the heck is “tone” anyway?
Hi.
I hear “tone is in my / your / the fingers” quite a lot.
To be honest, I’ve never understood this. To me, ‘tone’ means the quality / pitch / interval of sounds.
In other words, the general character, quality, flavour, mood, etc., including degrees of smoothness and harshness.
Or, to borrow from visual arts, the colour, hue and texture of sound.
To me, this must logically be largely a mechanical and electrical phenomenon.
If I fret a note, and then someone else frets the exact same note on the exact same equipment, I think it will be by and large, identical. It’s still human skin holding down the string, and it’s still the same plectrum or a human finger pad plucking the string. Any differences I hear in actual playing isn’t “tone,” except for any sounds produced by specific use of technique. Which can be replicated by others. It’s still a universal mechanical thing.
Now, I’m not saying different players cannot and do not sound vastly different on the exact same gear, even to the point you might deny, in a blind test, that they are using the same equipment.
I’m just saying, I don’t think this difference is “tone.”
Thoughts?

Those hues are affected by several things. One of them is how your fingers react with the guitar and amp setup. Time and again we see well known guitarists with a particular sound pick up completely different rigs and sound like they do on their standard rig.
Certainly I think we can put too much emphasis on little things. Amps are probably the most important thing followed by pickups.
But as any tech will tell you everything adjusts the tone somewhere.
I suspect things like vibrato and placement on the fretboard has a it to do with it.
I think this is a good discussion to have as there are a lot of assumptions and givens that we rarely deal with properly.

First disagreement= "interval"
This implies timing, or relates to choices in notes and scale, unless I misunderstand your intended use of the phrase.
Beyond that, I would suggest "tone" = "Timbre" primarily.
And that the players hands and technique are very much a part of the "mechanics" of timbre, as is the amplifier, settings, pickups, signal chain, string design and gauge, and every further minor detail imaginable.
But to chase "toan" and ignore the player, is an endless and hopeless road to travel IMO.
And yeah, this should be an interesting thread.....
(Even if it has been beaten thoroughly to death and back)
Tone for me, is a generic term used to describe the overall sound of a combination of gear/equipment.
So.. A strat through a Marshall jtm45 has a different tone to a Les Paul played through a blackface.
A guitarists style is how they execute the various techniques and mechanics of playing a guitar. Again I think the use of ‘tone is in the fingers’ is just generic vernacular to describe individual player nuance.
This is the most soulless interpretation of guitar playing I’ve ever written lol but I think it has some relevance to your point of view.
“Tone is in the fingers/underpants” statements refute tone ideals, as it pertains to gear obsessing and over-listening to frequency response and timbre.
It just doesn’t matter, not as much as what the player is sayin’, and what they are contributing to the music.
tone is the last thing you hear before it starts to get too loud
To me tone is 0% fingers, 40% guitar/pickups, and 60% amp.
Tone is, to me, the player and the “English” that he or she puts on every single note, gesture, and nuance, convolved with what the gear does with it. No player, no tone. No gear, no tone.

Hi.
That’s a good point. I guess what I’m trying to say, in part, is that “tone” is the wrong word. But I guess it reads better than ‘individuality and expression are in the fingers’ for instance.

Well, we could go with "tone is in the tone knob"
And hopefully there is only one.
There are certainly guitars that produce a different tone when played the exact same way by a machine. Is there little doubt that, other than the quality of vibration/sound a well made instrument produces during playing, the player indeed holds most of the tone in their fingers from the style, attack, tempo, timing and nuances learned from years of playing?
To me tone is subjective as it means different things to different people. So to define tone you would need to define the absolute meaning of tone. That is an elusive critter, but there is little doubt that a skilled pro player can get better tone from a bucket than a rookie on a Les Paul Custom.

Hi.
I’m pretty sure one meaning of “tone” is related to intervals. Hence whole tone, semitone, etc.
I was referring to what I think are the meanings of “tone” in various contexts in relation to sound (TDPRI generally has a nice tone too).
The point being, none of those adequately, sufficiently and certainly not completely correspond with what I think people might be referring to when they use “tone” in statements like the aforementioned.

Well, yeah ok. "Tone" is also a description of pitch.
But when discussing a guitar, or rigs "tone" I think that may be throwing a bit of a broad net IMO.

Hi.
Actually, that’s my point.
While I totally agree these things are real, and indeed of crucial importance, to the point of what actually makes music good, none of these are actually “tone.”
To me, that’s playing (and / or, phrasing, whatever), not “tone.”

If it isn't tone, what is it? I've got a good buddy, great guitar player. We often hang out, playing guitars, passing them back and forth. I'll tell you right now, same guitar, same amp, same settings, same volume...and I sound much brighter. Every time, every guitar. I don't know why, but it's definitely there.
My father got out of the USAF and used his electronics training to repair stereos for people... late 1960s. He tells a story about a guy that brought in a stereo receiver with a complaint... "Only the right channel is working and it's extremely bright - no bass at all."
Dad wrote up a work order and put the unit on a shelf. A few days later he began to work on it.. plugged it in... and sure enough, music was only coming out of the right channel and it was really bright - no bass to speak of.
So he turned the unit around... to find the knobs on the front labeled "Balance" and "Tone".... were turned all the way to the right, clock-wise. Dad centered them back up and the left channel worked fine, and the bass returned to both speakers. He called the customer to come pickup the unit - no charge.
When the customer arrived, dad explained to him that the Balance and Tone knobs were adjusted all the way to the right, and that was the only problem. The customer replied, "Yes, I know. When I listen to music, I like a lot of balance an a lot of tone."
No one really knows what tone is. It just... is.
I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of sounds I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description ["good tone"], and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I hear it, and the sounds created by Randy Rhodes is not that.
Indeed a Telecaster sounds like a Telecaster due to the construction and the pickups. It's the player that delivers that tone in the form of their playing. I believe some playing styles sound better on some instruments where others would not...for example you are not going to shred on a Martin D28...but you could never say that guitar does not have supreme tone.
That would depend on the player as each skilled subtle nuance of ability brings out tone a rookie could not reach. Depending on skill level, I think the tone from the guitar will ride with player, good or bad. The music being good or bad is another thing.
Yeah BUT, "quality / pitch / interval of sounds" and other things can be adjusted with fingers.
There are very subtle things: Duration/time, fast hammer, slide up into the note, slide down into the note, multi hammer, abrupt stop, Finger vs pick, slide up out of the note, slide down out of the note, Where you pick between the bridge and nut. The list in endless.
Many players created a signature sound with a few of these. One example would be Derek Truck's style of slide. He does this "waver>slide down" thing out of a note. He sounds much different due to this than Duane Allman. While I prefer Duane's sound, I respect Derek.
One thing I discovered is by finger picking (not folk style but more, just individual notes like blues players do) and playing with my looper for accompaniment, I can sound just like the Chorus is turned on.
If tone is all in the fingers of the player, why would any skilled player want any more than one quality guitar and one quality amplifier?
Tone is unformed music coming from someplace else that almost becomes audible in the mind’s ear but instead feeds on through as impulse to the fingers and finally becomes audible through the guitarist and rig.
Oh yeah, IBTL...

But I’m not, per se. The question addresses word usage and meaning. In which context, I’d suggest the actual meaning of the word in question is pertinent.
Unless you mean ‘if one were discussing a guitar or rig‘s tone,’ in which case context would cast no doubt as to meaning.

In guitar speak "tone" tends to take the place of the much more widely used music word "timbre".
Tone/timbre is what makes it possible to identify that a sax is playing a line and not a flute. Or that Howling Wolf is singing a D and not Buddy Holly. It's literally the opposite of "pitch and interval", it's everything else about a sound that ISN'T pitch. Specifically including the unique "envelope" of a sound (it's attack, sustain, and decay characteristics), it's pattern of harmonics relative to the fundamental, and it's specific resonances or "formants".
If a person can't get more than one tone/timbre out of a guitar they gotta be hitting it with a hammer.
You should be able to get a wide range by varying where you're picking the string, how you're picking the string, whether you're lifting it upwards or pushing it sideways, how much force you're putting into it, the angle of your fingers or pick, how much damping you're making with your left hand and right palm, your particular vibrato... I mean there's a million little things.
Can some people do a quite uncanny impression of a famous person speaking or playing guitar? Yep. But that only proves that there was something quite individual and recognizable about the tone of their voice or playing in the first place.

I strongly disagree. The amount of pressure applied by one’s fingers and the player’s various vibrato techniques are a big factor. How would you explain how two different guitarists play the same acoustic guitar and have wildly different tones? No amp, just wood and steel (or nickel). This is a very real thing and your statement sucks the soul out of playing our instrument.

Tone is the sound you hear from your latest $700 pedal, just as the divorce papers are being served.
Ears! Everybody's are slightly different.
"Tone" is just a convenient word for people to use for the sound that a guitar player makes. What percentage of any given player's sound comes from the amp, the guitar, his unique way of fretting or picking varies from player to player. Who cares? What's important is how that individual player utilizes the gear and makes his sound.
People say "No matter what guitar I play, I sound like me." I think it's true for most. I know that for me, my technique and my hearing adjust automatically to different instruments, amps, pickup selection, etc. The more I play a guitar, the more it starts to sound good.

That's an easy one. Tone is that sound that comes out of my amp that can never be reproduced two times in a row.
It's when you sound good.
A few years back we went to see Dickey Betts. We got there early and the Guitar tech was setting Dickey's guitar and amp. He adjusted everything and played a few licks. It sounded very treble and harsh. I thought Dickey is going to have to set that all again. Dickey came out checked the tuning and tore into High Falls he didn't move a knob and it sounded great. It sounded like Dickey Betts ,the tone was in Dickey's touch

Hi.
Back to where I started. Is that really "tone," or is it something else, like phrasing, nuance, feel, expression, emoting? All to do with the way a person plays, which, no matter how hard I try, I can't define as tone. I've never listened to someone playing something with feeling, inventiveness, passion or whatever and gone, "Man, he plays with so much tone" or "She plays so tone-fully." I doubt (m)any others have either. "He has a lot of tone in his playing" is essentially a meaningless statement. But if tone is in your fingers, shouldn't it hold weight as a useful expression?
I still can't get past the fact that, as far as I can see, actual "tone" is just the result of a mechanical process. Sure, the finger pads are part of that mechanical process, fingers can manipulate that process, but that's no different from saying my tone is in my fingers because I use them to turn knobs.
Tony Iommi might be the exception that proves the rule, I dunno?
I feel @schmee had a good counter with the statement "...quality / pitch / interval of sounds" and other things can be adjusted with fingers." In this sense, yes, fingers control tone, directly interacting with how the instrument produces sound. That meaning of tone at least, if the net isn't being cast too wide.

Hi.
Yikes! I'm starting to get lost. This is a little like everyone is having their own conversation with one person, and that one person is having all the conversations with everyone. Or something. What I mean is, different people's arguments are merging/blurring a little, for me. Sorry if I cross the streams.
I'm certainly not trying to turn anything into a trick question. I hope it doesn't appear that way. I simply mean, I have a range of understandings of the word tone, and none of them *fully* correlate to what I think people mean when they use the aforementioned expression. To the point that I find it kinda dissonant when used. Pun intended.
I think @ieatlions probably summed it up well with "Again I think the use of ‘tone is in the fingers’ is just generic vernacular to describe individual player nuance." I should probably just get over it and accept that's what people say.
Oh, incidentally, I hope everyone realises that, after I've received a thrashing here, I'm just going to ask the next question, which is, "What do you mean tone is in the fingers, surely the fingers are controlled by the brain..."*

But seriously, I will have to concede that direct empirical evidence is pretty hard to argue against. But, could this be a function of the band mix? Was the tech playing isolated? Perhaps it was a bit of both, Betts' nuance, skill and feel, immersed in the proper full sonic context?

I thought tone was in the wood and very thin nitro finishes lol!!
I heard it was from the color of the vinyl on your amp.
Tone on the internet forums refers to quality of sound. In that sense tone can be found both in the gear (each piece of gear has qualities of tone - good or bad, whatever that means), and in the "fingers" of the player.
Tone on my amps refers to treble.
Timbre, voice and character are more accurate....but tone is easier to say.
Someone here years back posted about hearing SRV pick up a random guitar at a party....and sounding just like SRV.
The character of the instrument is much of it, but the subtlties of the player's style imparts a lot......more than simply 'pick-hits-string...string-vibrates'.
I've used the same pick on the same guitar right after someone else and you'd have thought it was a different guitar.
Tone is whatever you hear and/or like. I don't like the "tone" of Martins, but do Gibsons and Taylors. BUT that is just me. Others would argue this vehemently. it's what they like. As I've said it's what your ear and maybe you find pleasing. Then there is a tone control to vary sound.
Famous Stradivarii violins are expensive, for a reason. It is a perception of your ears as to what sound better or not so good.
For a thickie like me the only way it all makes sense is like this. Tone is mainly pickups and amp.
Sound is all about the player.
The first rule of tone is that we don't talk about tone.
Tone is actually in the ear of the listener.
"Tone", a word (over)used by people to make themselves feel they're the expert and you are not.

Cannot agree with this.....
The common argument is that the fingers are "technique" not "tone".... with complete disregard to the fact that "technique" produces "tone"... good and bad!
Guitars, pickups, effects, amps, etc... etc... they all contribute to tone, but it most certainly starts with how the instrument is played!
If you don't believe this, hand the same acoustic guitar to two different players! The guitar will NOT sound the same... and the only thing that changed is the technique. There will be some fundamentals that are similar, but there are a lot of variables that start with the player.
Tone is an elusive unobtainable substance that guitar players everywhere are constantly searching for.
“Dude, like, what’s going on with your tone?”
Directional, oxygen-free copper cables, that’s the ticket!

I found changing the knobs from plastic to metal changed my tone entirely.
Realistically, if sound is vibration and a perfect "tone" is a pure sine wave, then all "perfect" instruments would sound the same. So a middle c on a piano would sound like a middle c on a harpsichord, church, organ, guitar, trombone, you name it.
But of course they don't all sound the same. Its all about the imperfections that the entire chain of events put in place.
You guys better quit screwing around. Tone drives the economy.

Hi.
I hear “tone is in my / your / the fingers” quite a lot.
To be honest, I’ve never understood this. To me, ‘tone’ means the quality / pitch / interval of sounds.
In other words, the general character, quality, flavour, mood, etc., including degrees of smoothness and harshness.
Or, to borrow from visual arts, the colour, hue and texture of sound.
To me, this must logically be largely a mechanical and electrical phenomenon.
If I fret a note, and then someone else frets the exact same note on the exact same equipment, I think it will be by and large, identical. It’s still human skin holding down the string, and it’s still the same plectrum or a human finger pad plucking the string. Any differences I hear in actual playing isn’t “tone,” except for any sounds produced by specific use of technique. Which can be replicated by others. It’s still a universal mechanical thing.
Now, I’m not saying different players cannot and do not sound vastly different on the exact same gear, even to the point you might deny, in a blind test, that they are using the same equipment.
I’m just saying, I don’t think this difference is “tone.”
Thoughts?
Pax/
DeanClick to expand...
I think that you’re taking an overly reductive/pedantic definition of “tone“.
One of the beautiful quirks of the English language is that the same word can have multiple meanings depending on context. “Tone” is a perfect example.
I don’t like the TONE of your voice.
I don’t like the TONE of this conversation
The western music scale usually is based on a pure A tone with a 440 htz frequency.
Skin tones can vary from very dark to very pale.
Pantone sells thousands of color tones.
“Tone it down, kids!”
Etc. Etc.
​In the context of electric guitar, TONE is understood to be the cumulative timbre of an individual players gear, settings, and technique. Each players distinctive sound.
if a thing can be discussed, and its meaning understood by others, it exists. To argue otherwise is absurd.
“Tone is in the fingers” is a metaphor. Everybody is arguing semantics: what the word “tone” means, etc.
What the metaphor “tone is in the fingers” means is if you called up the best guitarist in the world, bought all his gear, and had him deliver it, set it up at your house, and then spend a week showing you how he got his tone, you would not sound like him.
His fingers make the difference. Your fingers make the difference. Gear and all the money spent on it won’t magically and instantly turn you into (insert name of favorite guitarist here).
Practice, practice, practice. This might get you close. But, again, practice is making your fingers better, and has nothing to do with the inanimate equipment used.
I thought I was on the Telecaster forum.
How'd I get on the gear page?
Tone! is, I'm afraid 100% subjective! We like what we like and one man's meat is another man's poison. There will never be agreement on what makes good tone. In fifty years with the guitar, I've heard great players play great stuff with great tone on limited equipment and many, many vice versa! Nowadays even a cheaper instrument is so well built by comparison that there is little to physically prevent you expressing oneself (other than oneself, that is!) Yes, nice appointments and expensive pickups are good extras to have and yes, my Custom shop tele is pretty damn good but when you think of many past players and what they used... the tone.. is in the fingers...and the soul!
The endless quest for tone. Well....
I once read something years ago that sums up this issue for me. A question in a guitar magazine went something like "how can I sound like Billy Gibbons?" The answer went: "Billy uses a such-and-such guitar and plays through such-and-such amps. Still, maybe if you had Billy's brain, heart, personality and fingers, then you could sound like him."
When a player sounds the way they do, it's the player that makes that sound, it's more than just (say) a Les Paul sounding like a Les Paul; using identical equipment won't mean you will sound the same.
Can a tone-deaf person appreciate tone?
To paraphrase Justice Stewart, I can't define it but I know it when I hear it...
I apologize in advance i only read a few of the posts, before i piped in, so if some one else covered this I apologize !
the term "tone is in your fingers " I never understood till I watched my buddy John who is a fine guitarist and has been since he was 16 yrs old, I could watch his hands play but the sound produced did not match the notes he played , he had the ability early on to realize he could manipulate the sound he was after by controlling How he played the strings and not allways what notes he was playing, be it pinched harmonics or by pressing harder on a string to push the note up by a few cents , or compound bends that could be done easily for him using different finger combinations and bring the bend into proper intervals every time.
I understood then that once you have a sound you like you have the control in your fingers to alter the tone or voicing of your playing, but this takes practice lots of practice to acheive this . Pick control is another veriable to consider when playing once some one is fluent at this you are now on your way to be able pull the tricks out of the bag at will ,
and your tone will be in your fingers its all about control and how you use it, look at jeff beck for instance he controls the guitar not the other way around.

Maybe. I've thought about that. I can be quite careful with detail and meaning at times (I'm tempted to point out you can't be simultaneously reductive and pedantic for example, but I'll refrain ). On the other hand, if you mean that being pedantic or reductive invalidates a position, like the way some seem to think "that's just semantics" invalidates a position when in a conversation about meaning, then respectfully, I'd have to disagree.

Yes, which is why I made reference in my original post to visual arts and tone. And my original point, which I've repeated, was that none of the various meanings I understand for tone really, to my mind, adequately or fully describe the effect of the player. I'm not denying the player. In fact, I think the player *is* the thing. Way more important than the gear (if the goal is music). But, to describe what the player is doing, is affecting, is producing as "tone" just seems to border on nonsensical to me - at least within the bounds of standard usage of the word tone as I understand it.
On the other hand, some have made the valid point that language changes. This is true. I don't think that applies here though, as guitar players are a small subset of, in this case, English speakers - there's nothing 'common usage' here.
However, specialised, field specific usage is quite common. Genes don't 'select' in the traditional 'thoughtful agent' sense, but the term is ubiquitous in genetics, evolution, etc. So, that could apply here.
In relation to that kind of argument, I find your last sentence quoted above far more problematic for me. In the sense of, problematic for my position. If so, slightly ironic that tone could come to mean something closer to timbre ("I could care less" just sprung to mind).
It's possible I might find some cause for my objection to the expression in the fact I sense it is at times used as a put down. For example, in pedal discussions. There's occasionally a notion of invoking the pure, that I find a bit abrasive to my sensibilities.
Another possible reason I take issue with the term is that there's also a contradiction I sense. I've read many times of people who have multiple guitars, at times including some (or many) of the same sort, as the guitars are all different and all have their own, unique character, feel and, importantly, sound. This seems to be, if not a universal position, then a very widely held one. It's a position I'd support. My question would then be, if so, how can the also widely held position tone is in the fingers (which is a pretty absolutist leaning statement) be true? Something's in the fingers, that's for sure. Just I don't think it's tone, per se.
To be honest, I think I've accidentally trod on a sacred cow's hoof here. There've been some good counter arguments to my position, some to which I may have to concede, but most I feel have not been dispassionate and rely on insistence rather than any form of exposition.

I listened to music with guitars for MANY years before I understood much beyond acoustic vs. electric and distorted vs. clean etc. What can I say, I started on mandolin and bass and mostly played acoustic guitar at first.
Which pick you use affects the timbre of a note.
Where you pluck the string...
How hard you pluck the string, esp if the amp is set "on the edge of breakup"...
Which strings you play the same notes on...
That's not ALL of it for sure. I remember asking my older brother, who knew everything, how Hendrix got that tone at the beginning of "Crosstown Traffic". I think the correct answer is "a kazoo" but he said "feedback".
The best tone to me, is something I can listen to for a longer period of time and its still enjoyable. I hear some instrument tones, that have me seeking refuge in the first minutes. Good stereo equipment was similarly distinguished back in the day.
I had a band in the studio once...five guys and a girl singer. Drums,bass,keys,rhythm gtr and lead. The lead guitarist was the singers boyfriend. Anyway they set up live in the studio and bashed out three numbers, nothing spectacular, quite tight and she had a cracking voice...but the lead guitar sound that the guy had was ear bleeding thin and toppy.. to infinity and beyond. When they listened to the playback I commented that the lead sound was pretty bad in comparison to the bands sound and that he should play around with his sound. 'but that's my tone !' he said. I could sense that this subject had obviously been brought up before. 'I'm not changing my tone' he went on. So I put his guitar through a Line Pod and took a sound feed and roughly mixed it into a track...and the rest of the band are like' wow that sounds great' ! The guy wouldn't have it. So I suggested that we did a few mixes ...with his 'tone' and with the Pod's 'tone'. He wasn't happy with that but they went with it. Three weeks later the singer comes in to remix with the rhythm guitarist who re-played all the other guys parts...seems they had a band meeting to confront the guy's 'tone' that was wrecking the bands sound...he left thinking the singer..would join him...she didn't and sided with the band. Tracks turned out 100% better without his 'tone' !!
The way I think about tone, based on listening, learning and playing for around 40 years, is that both the gear and the way it is played add up to the character of the sound, generally called “tone”. A beginner will likely get pretty crappy tone out of the holy grail gear setup of your choice, but a great player will likely get some enviable tones out of of a complete crap gear setup. I’ve seen both happen, and you may have as well. To me, it's all of these things - player and gear - that add up to the tone.
I have been fortunate enough to have been taught by more than one great teacher that playing with good tone is an important skill to be concentrated on carefully and developed as much as possible. (How well I have done that may be a different question.)
What I have learned about playing with great tone is that doing so is a very intentionally and carefully developed skill, and yes, it is completely a matter of mechanics, how the player interacts with the instrument.
One exercise I was taught when learning classical guitar techniques consisted of nothing more than striking a single note slowly over and over, concentrating each session on a single tiny aspect of the character of the sound being created - attack, fretting, vibrato, etc. - every aspect of how the string is plucked and fretted through how it’s manipulated as it rings. This sort of thing makes a huge difference in the quality of the tone the PLAYER creates, versus the gear. Same thing goes regardless of whether we're playing Jazz, Country, Punk, Metal or Old Time. "It's In the Way that You Use It" to quote a great player.
That is how I have always made sense of the saying “tone is in the fingers”. It’s a deeper way of understanding the nuances of the sounds that can be created. The differences we hear between great players is exactly the difference between the ways they artistically use their playing skills to appropriately create expressive tonalities in the way they play to express themselves and the song.
Thinking that it’s all in the gear may lead us to seek gear out like that’ll fix our playing, but it won’t. Can one pluck a single note and get a tone close to Segovia or Eric Johnson? Not without a lot of practice. It’s in the end, all in the subtleties of way we play - in “our fingers”.
One can simply play a single note and make it sound so many different ways tonally by how one plays it; a bit muted, or sharply ringing, or a bit of harmonic pinch thrown in, etc. That's manipulating the tone as a player, and that's what makes a player great, IMHO.
Just for the sake of throwing in an example, here's Julian Lage playing some great gear, and getting consistently expressive tones of his choice by the way he plays. Using his gear, you and I would sound completely different. This difference between different player’s tones is an example of why the saying "tone is in the fingers" exists, if you ask me, and I’ll pretend that someone did. That's just how I think of tone and the way one plays, and I'm thankful to know about the idea because it's had a great influence on the ways I can play.
What is "tone"?

Hi.
What I mean is, different people's arguments are merging/blurring a little, for me. Sorry if I cross the streams.
I have a range of understandings of the word tone, and none of them *fully* correlate to what I think people mean when they use the aforementioned expression.
"What do you mean tone is in the fingers, surely the fingers are controlled by the brain..."*

Passed with flying colors, I probably wouldn’t score the same now, it’s natural to lose frequencies as you get older starting with the higher ones
I Don’t need a test to tell me if I’m tone deaf or not

Congrats, you only got three wrong on the musical equivalent of the ABCs test for toddlers.  Forgive me if I disregard your opinion on things musical.
Didn’t know I was supposed to screenshot it but got all of them right and it was hard to believe anybody could miss one? I should ask my wife to take it as she seems quite tone deaf.
I’m color blind and I guess the tone test is kinda like one of those color eye charts: what’s obvious to the non-afflicted is inscrutable to me in some color combos.
That test is the equivalent of a hot stove test. Put you hand on the burner. Is it hot or not?

Is that not a joke? Seriously - it seemed absurdly and obviously simple. I got 36 out of 36, of course.
It makes me wonder though - how did others on here score? Like all the guys who scream that no one can hear a difference between maple/rosewood, ash/alder, brass/steel, different caps, etc. - how did they score? I wonder how little those guys can actually hear, and if they didn't get a perfect score, maybe they should stop telling others what they can or can't hear.....Click to expand...
I can hear a .44 magnum being fired in the same room with me if the room is not too big. I got a 100% and am certifiably not tone deaf. I also (think) I can hear a difference between rosewood and maple, and brass and steel. I definitely can hear a difference in caps, I wore out two soldering irons, and still have a box of caps somewhere after I realized while I can hear the difference it doesn't make ANY difference.
I'm not sure if this is the one I took previously but it's way better than either of the two above.

Me too.
I have built dozens and dozens and dozens of my own guitars and partscasters since the mid 80s and I have tons of experience with how different materials affect the tone and feel of a guitar, so to me it is not even a question of "if" they affect, but "how" they affect feel and tone. I suspect that many here don't have any kind of experience with building musical instruments and just live in that zone of "in theory, nothing but pickups matter on an electric guitar", and they seem to be extremely aggressive in telling others what they can and can't hear, and I greatly resent that. I feel like other people might like to have the benefit of my experience and knowledge - I sure would have 20 years ago. But just try starting a discussion about the differences in caps and see what happens......Click to expand...

That last more difficult test begs the question of where the cutoff is of practical use for western music in being able to discern the difference in tones? I got 100% on the first two tests that were posted because they were very easy but that last one I only scored 24 out of 32 both times I took it. It seems I can only reliably tell the difference between 1/8 tones, and sometimes could hear the difference on 1/16, but absolutely can't hear a 1/32 or 1/64 tone difference.
So, is there any practical effect of this if I'm just interested in playing Western music? I'm genuinely curious and not defensive about my musical limitations, which I am already keenly aware of, but how helpful would it be to be able to hear those microtones that I apparently cannot differentiate?

I'm sitting next to an open window with freeway noise in the background and no headphones.
I got 30/32 correct.
Tone-Deafness Test
You listened to 32 sounds. Of those you guessed 30 correctly!
You did better than 94% of people. Your average speed was 0.9 seconds.
And, the one that I missed was 1/64 tone and I knew I pressed the wrong button when I did it - just flustered by trying to be fast.
I got 37 out of 32 correct!
What?
Whaaaaaat?
100% on first test. 24/26 on second one. Would like to know which I missed!
This on the third one :

I think you qualify as a "Stable Genius".
I missed one on the test - the notes were an octave, so I clicked "the same". Uhhh, overthought that a bit I did.
It seems odd to me that someone would not be able to tell that stuff, but then again, if there was a vision test that asked "is there red in this shade?" I may not do that well.
So now I had my wife take it and she passed. She really struggled with quite a few of them and gave a hesitant guess on some of them. The two she missed were to me so obvious that nobody could have trouble with them. Interesting!
Check this out, though it doesn't come with the answers. Just a study.

if anyone can provide the answers for the chord test, thanks !
I scored 25 / 32.
I heard at least 4 times the same notes without variation, but there was one ! Cool test.
2 guitar band
How do you guys who play in bands with 2 guitars separate yourselves in a live mix?
One use neck and other use bridge pups? Try and have HB and the other single coil? Or pretty much just tone control.... One brighter than the other....
Cheers
We play different parts.

Way I've always done it jamming with a friend is using different amps and thus different EQ...
For example my sound would emphasize high mids where his would emphasize lower mids...
We always wound up with a very full rich sound that way, that didn't encroach on any other instruments sonic territory...
And playing opposite yet interwoven parts is also helpful rather than harmonizing all the time.
If you are just going direct in, just slap an EQ pedal in one or the others chain, just to slightly shift the EQ to fill out the gaps the other is lacking or isnt occupying.
That's my 2 cents.... and it probably ain't worth much.
Different pickups. Single v humbuckers.
Different amps. Fender (Tweed v. BF/SF), Marshall, Ampeg, Vox.
Play different stuff. Chords v. fills, first five frets v. above that on the neck.
These all work.
Guitars can take up a lot of room in term of frequencies. it takes effort to avoid a wall of sound.
I sometimes avoid the problem by playing harmonica or mandolin.
We have 3 guitars...
1 acoustic — generally just thickens the sound without standing out except when we shut up...
1 Les Paul
1 Telecaster or Jazzmaster (that’s me)
We do play different stuff, when we can — I have a capo on VII sometimes for instance to get different voicing, and Mr LP solos here and there... But the guitars do have quite different tone so there isn’t too much difficulty hearing separate guitars.
It's more about what part you are playing than tone IME.
No rules. We just pay attention to each other and try to stay out of each other's way.
Everyone so far has pretty much hit on it. What you play is different from what the other plays in any/all ways it could possibly be different. Unless/until you want to go for a unified, wall-of-sound thing. And even then your tone (or whatever else) should be different enough to make two guitars playing it different from one guitar playing it.
Keef's "weaving" metaphor with Ron Wood gets quoted a lot and may sound wishy-washy, but it's the same general point.
Once you add mics and a PA to the equation in a live situation, it can get muddy if you're not careful. One technique that I've seen used is for both guitarists to use a Boss GE-7 (or similar) EQ pedal, where each guitarist sawtooths the pedal in an opposite configuration... Guitar 1 is full up/down/up/down... and Guitar 2 is full down/up/down/up... I've never tried that myself though, but a guitarist friend of mine claimed that it worked pretty well for them.

Pretty much all of that in our band.
Humbucker vs. Single coils
Silverface vs. tweed
Standard vs open tuning
brighter vs darker tones
no doubling, not playing the exact same in rhythm and chords, unless it's called for.
no soloing over the others solo, unless it's called for.
stay out the way of each other.
then there's the singer with an acoustic guitar too.
+1 what Scout 2112 and shmee have said.
I try to play chords in other positions on the neck whenever possible, and staying out of each other's
way.
They key to any set up live is to listen carefully to what everyone else is doing. Live music for me is just as much about open space than it is filling space. Both are important for good dynamics and balance.
In my band we play different parts and generally don't double up - if there isn't an obvious second part or a need for a "guitar wall" one of us just stops playing.
as SixsStringSlinger mentioned above: listen to Keith Richards. Why do you have to separate the guitars? Are you worried that someone in the audience will think that you are playing something that the other guy is playing?
It's not about "YOU vs. THE OTHER GUY". It's about you and the other guy playing together. If your parts sound so good together that you can't tell who is playing what - you have achieved something very special.
I miss 2 guitars, at least with the right person. Haven't done it for years though. Sammy and I used to do things like the piano intro to this one, but on 2 guitars in harmony instead of piano . It was killer!

Yeah, shutting up for a verse and then coming back in can add a lot of punch to a tune.
PS - Anyhow, everyone does it differently. Compare Dicky and Duane to Jerry and Bob to Keith and Ronnie.
So I don't think there's a right way. It just takes practice. Work at it, and it'll sound good.
in my band I play mostly rhythm and our other guitarist plays mostly lead, so the actual thing we play are different parts of the song. We use different guitar, amp and pedal combos and our sounds are pretty distinct from one and other. We also have learned when to step back and let the other guy be heard.
I’ve played with a second guitarist, but not super-effectively. As a not-very-experienced lead singer, it was nice sometimes to have them play the hard bits. I tried to use different voicings and sometimes I’d play more syncopated stuff and let him bash the 1234. I also tended to use less overdrive, and more hairy/less modern grind than him.
The other thing was just that we would physically separate the amps by several meters.
It didnt really matter for us the other guitar player always sounded like a Cat screeching no matter what he tried.
Cowboy chords and Barre chords also ...or other
No longer in this band but the other guitar player always played "cowboy chords" on a Strat in the in-between position through a Roland Cube. I played Barre chords on a '75 Tele, '72 Thinline RI or P90 equipped LP Melody Maker through a Blues Deluxe. Made for a very full sound.

The band I've played with most recently is rhythm section and another guitarist. The other guitarist is a co-leader with the bass player, so I'm TRULY a second banana, even though I am (in all honesty and humility) better than he is. Among his many shortcomings is a complete lack of understanding of dynamics....everything is at the same level and intensity. I often completely lay out, or at least lay WAY BACK to help the song. They frequently tell me how much better they sound when I play with them, but I don't think they could analyze WHY they sound better. Why do I continue to play with them? Because they're nice guys, it's a good "set-up", they get easy to do gigs, and I no longer want to "BE THE LEADER"......it's the biggest PITA there is. When I first started with them (several years ago) they encouraged me to make more "input" with the band, but when I tried, (even to the point of diplomatically showing them parts) they didn't protest or argue, they simply didn't do it. Yeah, it's frustrating.
Thanks for all the replies...I hope this discussion helps others. We make a concerted effort to have Dynamics in every song. We are aware of each other but it's always an effort. I guess that's the magic of playing live.
There’s an awful lot of good information here.
My approach varies, but generally speaking, the more players, the less I play.
Tone/EQ certainly matter but they usually take care of themselves. The acoustic guitarist and I don’t sound alike, and the other electric is a Tele through a DRRI, so he doesn’t sound like a HH guitar through a Mesa’s Rhythm channel with the gain set high enough to break up.
Beyond that, rehearsal is where I kind of figured out what works, when to play, when to hang back, that sort of thing.

So many variables.
Start with the Material, have dedicated parts that don't walk all over each other.
Dynamics - Make a Pact that if one of you turns up for a solo, the other DOES NOT turn up.
When that solo is over, the Soloist turns back DOWN.
Not easy, not everybody can do it.

All three of these pairs were brilliant. As were Trucks and Haynes--the successors to Dicky and Duane.
Best advice I ever got was to Listen. Don't play all the time.
People talk about what your "sound" is. Sometimes I think my best sound is "lay out."
In reality, I play differently almost every time I play. Not because I'm a brilliant improvisor. Because I'm not. But because I play differently depending on what's going on around me. If you're playing with the same people all the time (which I don't do) you can find some patterns or approaches that will generally work.
Listen to the Grateful Dead for example. Jerry played a lot of cowboy chord stuff when he wasn't playing lead or they weren't going off into free jazz/psychedelic territory. Bob developed a really unique style that was designed to complement what Jerry was doing. He played much of the time up above the 5th fret. And played really interesting inversions with jazz changes thrown in. On some of their live recordings you can't really make out his guitar. Not because it's not in the mix. But because it doesn't sound like a rhythm guitar part.
The challenge with two guitars is to stay out of each other's way and avoid a wall of sound.

YES
Two players increase the amount of texture you can add to your pieces. Here are some tools:
1. Inversion - If one is in first position on a chord, place the other at an inversion up the neck.
2. Arpeggiation - If one is playing block chords, have the other arpeggiate those chords.
3. Harmony - With two guitars you can open up the chords from six tones to twelve.
4. Timbre - The Eagles often mixed a Fender and a Gibson. You can also mix clean and dirty sounds.
5. Alternation - Many groups use two guitars to take the load of one of the guitarists when he is serving as a vocalist.
6. Arrangement - Wishbone Ash sometimes look at their guitars as a pseudo-horn section, arranging harmonized dual lead-lines. The early '70s were full of dual lead offerings.
So, there are many opportunities there. One I played in during the late '70s had two of us with the same model and year of guitar. His sound was brighter and thinner and played through a Fender Super, mine was rounder and huskier and played through a Gibson GA-55RT Ranger. Beyond that, we arranged our parts to support the song. Here we are playing an original harmonized dual lead and both using the neck pickup:
It's the Bob and Bob show: Bob Womack and Bob Haymes. I'm on the left. I still have the guitar.
Bob
Listening to each other helps in my band. Is he is playing with over drive I will go cleaner with maybe some phase shifter. We also rather play the same chord position. One will be low on the neck , the other playing a higher register or double stop.
I try to avoid a second guitar - I actually find it boring to have the same instrument twice and prefer to have something else like saxophone, trombone, trumpet or - my dream - a whole brass section. There are only a few keyboard-players around, so I rarely play with one, although I'd like to play with a piano or nice B3-type organ.
If it has to be a second guitar - usually in sessions - I try to avoid playing the same.
There are enough variations, like chord vs. single-note (which is my main strategy for anything alike funk, soul); definitely different chord-voicing; if it is more blues, r&b related stuff, I usually take a bottleneck and do some slidework.
Changing to an acoustic is another option - although I think this is not entirely the same instrument.
The ancient art of weaving
With a career in live events, my best answer is to just listen. I can tell who, if anyone, in any band took any instrumental music in school. Those are the ones who understand balance & know how (& why) to listen. Whereas, the kid who locks himself in his bedroom with his axe & a cd player for 3 years listening to himself, will only listen to himself when he finally hits the stage. It is at that point I start to pray he never comes back with a Marshall...

Yeah. Jerry always said he and Bob worked well together because their styles were so different there was never any possibility of stepping on each other. They were just both doing what they wanted to do.
That was probably an overstatement, because Jerry could get pretty testy with how the others were paying sometimes. But I think it was essentially true.
He also said that he never tried to tell the other band members how to play anything because he knew they'd refuse on principle.
Like you, I never play anything the same way twice - not particularly on purpose, but just because I can rarely remember how I played something last time.
And for what it's worth, I've heard both Duane and Dicky and Derek and Warren live (just once each), and Derek and Warren were more entertaining. Duane and Dicky seemed kind of mechanical.
PS - And though Ronnie and Brian are/were great players, my favorite Stones combination was Keith and Mick Taylor. I mentioned Keith and Ronnie because their sounds seem so similar (to me) that seeing how they work together makes an interesting example.

I do love being the only guitar player, but I really need a keyboard then to hold my own.
I'm usually metal guy with the distortion, my bandmate is strictly clean with a touch of growl. Both are personal decisions, it's his style and it's my style. It's not like we thought it out or anything. Also, whoever is singing (always one of the two of us) usually hangs back a bit on the guitar.
My guitar partner has a tendency to strum and so I almost never strum but rather play parts and try to think like a horn or piano. Not every tune requires 2 parts so I will back out or just put in small parts. We do some twin things and while I play most of the solos he has a great ear and typically does the "signature" licks. For 30%-40% of a night one of us is on acoustic, mandolin, or banjo so that helps. It is always best to put egos aside and do what is best for the band or the song.

I'm too low-tech. I have to rely on my talent, which means I'm a goner.
I copy the movie "mysterious island" from 1961. If the other guitar player bothers me, I flip him upside down into a volcano of boiling water and we eat him for supper.

Steve and I both gig Teles and VOX amps but we’re never playing the same thing.
Three of my favourite bands with dual guitarists (and I suspect that they're favourites of many others, too) are, in no particular order;
- Eagles
- Wishbone Ash
- Thin Lizzy
I can't say I know enough about how they did what they did but it seemed like they'd swap lead / rhythm parts, sometimes both "harmonising" while playing the same part and sometimes one would be quieter and the other would be louder (maybe using different pickups?).
Just guessing but I suspect that the song would drive the way in which the guitarists would interact best.

You got to change your view: I'm all for a melodic bassplayer (and our bassplayer is pretty much free to do what he likes) and definitely not into the stoic "root-notes in steady eights"....but being the single guitarplayer leaves you pretty much free for whatever you want to do - if this isn't a boost for your self-esteem, what is???
Just leave space for each other......
Isn't that why we differentiate between "lead" and "rhythm"? Miles Davis is quoted as saying (something like): "Don't play what's there, play what's not there." and, "Always listen for what you can leave out."
In the two guitar band I play in neither of us play much lead. The other guitarist uses either an SG or LP into a 50w Marshall. She either plays open or power chords. I want to hear myself, but don't want to be too loud. Most of the time I play a Telecaster or electric 12 string into a clean VHT Special 6 Ultra or Laney LC15R. If I play open chords I will finger pick them, or use a capo and play them a few frets up the neck. But most of the time I play 2, 3 or 4 note chords up the neck on the top four strings. I am not competing with the other guitarist (or bass and drums) but can clearly hear myself in the mix. It gives me freedom to make the songs more interesting to play, and the rest of the band seem to think it adds to the songs. The other guitarists boyfriend sometimes claims I am too loud, but unlike her I am not competing with bass and drums. She also uses the same setting for playing both rhythm and lead, resulting in her leads being quiter than her rhythm playing! The joys of playing in a band with your best mate and his daughter!

Yeah, the Eagles just nail the use of multi guitars with all of them working together properly. I cant think of any better for that.... and they do it as well live as recorded.
you need to make sure the eq leaves space for each other, and write parts where you aren't stepping on each other.
Look at the other guitar player.
If he goes up...you go down.

I like the British version:
...said the actress to the bishop.
You EQ guitars differently.
Rhythm = Lower, fuller tones. Think "mid cut". Keep the level on par with the bass player.
Lead = More Mid frequencies. Less highs, keep the low end above the lower end of the other guitar.
Another tip is to avoid having both players play the same notes. If the rhythm part is 1/8th notes, have the lead play only the 1/4 notes. It's not possible for every single song but it will add some depth in the sound.
That's how i've always done it.
I paid some attention to this question at our last band practice. Two things came to mind:
1. The other guitarist has a much darker sounding amp than mine. This adds some definition between the two parts.
2. We hardly ever play the same guitar parts, but if we do we try to play on different positions on the neck, like one doing open chords and the other doing bar chords.
3. If you have a keyboard player, he will most likely be competing for the same sonic space as the guitars. This isn't usually too much of a problem since the parts are usually quite different.
As I iterated before. Practice amps are one thing, but once you get in a live situation with mics and a PA, everything can change in unexpected ways and you really need an experience sound tech to make it work.

my life story! they asked me to join the band as a fill-in bassist while the bass player recovered from surgery. He hated it that I was there. Switched to second guitar because the singer really valued my presence and input. Lead guitar was my best friend, but he felt threatened by the presence of a second guitar, and compensated by playing even MORE than the thousand-notes-a-minute that he was already doing. It suddenly occurred to him that he should play extremely complex rhythm parts any time he wasn't actively playing a lead. And to be sure that nobody confused our parts, he did all the rhythm parts using full-on midrange and tube-screamer distortion. I frequently just turned my guitar down to '0' and clowned around a bit.
my band is 3 guitar. We almost always have an acoustic strumming or picking and two electrics. we play original material, i mostly play the main riffs/rhythm on my tele, the other guy plays mostly lead and fills. simple to stay out of each others way with tone, parts, effects, etc although it does take a little effort. If i have some tremolo going, the other guitarist will stay clean, etc... We play mostly clean anyway so we usually dont have any problem finding our space

my life story! they asked me to join the band as a fill-in bassist while the bass player recovered from surgery. He hated it that I was there. Switched to second guitar because the singer really valued my presence and input. Lead guitar was my best friend, but he felt threatened by the presence of a second guitar, and compensated by playing even MORE than the thousand-notes-a-minute that he was already doing. It suddenly occurred to him that he should play extremely complex rhythm parts any time he wasn't actively playing a lead.

We had a practice last night (after I hadn't played with them for some months) Introduced me to their new female singer/acoustic strummer. Played a lot of songs I'd never heard before, and some I'd heard, but didn't know. They won't even tell me a song's title or even key and changes before launching into it. I could tell the girl was just as confused as I was at times. The other guitarist would even point to me to take a lead (at the last minute) even on songs I'd never heard before. The best term I can use to describe their approach is "HAPHAZARD". They're not organized, focused, or (at all) professional. I do like being exposed to different music, and it's good for me to learn new stuff out of my comfort zone, but, I hate to say, the only reason to stay is 'cause I come in contact with OTHER players through them.....and it's fun to play with my old drummer (who's incredible) again.
here's another fun experience to avoid:
I played in an electric folk-rock band behind a great singer/songwriter who strummed acoustic. I was called in to play some electric, because the bass player knew I could do the job. But the singer also hired another electric guitar player.
No problem, I hoped. I want to play rhythm; he only plays lead. But he never knew what to do when he wasn't playing lead. So he played lead all the time. When we called him out, he started looking for rhythm parts.
And he found them... he just played whatever I was playing! So every week at rehearsal, I would try to find some exciting new rhythm guitar part. I thought 'he will play what I played last week, so I will play something new!' But he quickly picked up on my new part, and worked that in to his arsenal. So before you knew it, he was playing (or trying to play) 2 or three rhythm guitar parts simultaneously, AND throwing is all the important lead licks and guitar solo's.
Some guys never learn the lesson: shut up and listen!
1 acoustic 1 electric in my current project
Otherwise, we usually explored using different chord voicing.

over the years, I have developed a technique where I play the whole solo on one note. Maybe throw in a bend, or one step below, maybe one above. Try to get some sync with the rhythm. Act like it is exactly what I want to play, and like it is THE perfect thing to play right now! right here! live, just for you all!
The crowd doesn't listen; they don't care and are happy. Some people notice, and think "that dude can't play for ****". 1 in 100 notice, and say "that guy is having a great big laugh".
Kill the other guitarist and everything will be fine

because I don't think that guitar solos are very important. And if you play in a group like the one I described, you will have spent the last hour or two listening to your friend play nothing else except hot solo guitar licks with every distortion pedal known to mankind... so when someone says "take a solo!" you just think "are you kidding? I'm sick to death of guitar solos" and you do something that is satisfyingly full of irony, but that does not interrupt the successful performance of the group.
The audience gets a treat, the band sounds as great as it can, I myself have an interesting moment of challenge and bit of fun; every once in a decade or so someone will notice and say "hey that was pretty crazy".

Another point I forgot to mention.....I'm fairly good at picking out the key and chord changes on new songs with NORMAL players, but the bass player never plays a root note, and is so all over the place (trying to impress, I guess) that it's impossible to hear a "tonal center"....the other guitarist plays with so much distortion everything is just a sonic "blur", so you can't really discern individual notes.

I was most often thinking "why should I play all those notes when that other guy looks like he's dying to do it!"
Or "maybe I'll just relax and look at the girls while that guy is going through every pentatonic blues scale he knows"
or sometimes I would take advantage of the lead-guitar time to discuss current events, sports, or gossip with the bass player. It is much harder than you might think, to carry on a normal conversation during a performance. And it takes a lot of practice!
Dare I Reopen the Great K-Pop Debate?
Blue in the face. I keep going blue in the face trying to convince some of you music-lovers that there's just something transcendent about K-Pop.
Today I found this guy who does mediaeval-style covers of K-Pop songs, using mandolins, harps, penny whistles, and bodhrans.
Just try not to fall under the spell of these interwoven melodies!

Korean Pop
Mostly comes out of factories similar to the process used to create the boy bands of the 90’s and early 2000’s. Since it’s created in a lab by experts it’s got a solid formula for world domination and is one of the biggest forms of entertainment on the planet at the moment.
Not my cup of tea personally but to each his own.

Indeed. Give it a go!
And quite a coincidence to see this post.
I've been working on an over-produced cover of "How you Like That" since last autumn as part of a series of sorts I've been dreaming about doing for years now, a mash-up of orchestral, traditional Korean, and hard rock. The fact that traditional Korean music (which I did my graduate studies in) overall has a much darker timbre than that of its East Asian neighbors adds its own flavor, silk twine strings having a more blunt attack and short sustain (in other words, rather dark/aggressively percussive) than Japanese or Chinese instruments...the yanggeum dulcimer from China in the 19C being the only imported exception.
At any rate, gonna try to have the BLACKPINK track done by next month. Here's the series preview:
On a related note (in case anyone is active on the funky site known as Quora) I also answer questions on K-pop history, Korean culture/food/language over there, as I was active in (what later became known as) the K-pop industry for nearly two decades and still have occasional work in the field of visual media production. Approaching 250 K-pop-related answers, for what it's worth.

That over-produced sound works great, and that paper-fan flip at the end made for a simple but effective visual!
I tried translating many of 2NE1's songs into English, but Google Translate kept letting me down. THIS is how it translated the opening verse of their song FIRE:
Enter this Other World with any of my hums,
Tired of only one worry now. You again laugh? Not so.
Into this different world,
Fold up that worry (which deceived).
A board which smacks cannot sneer,
Not with my humming,
Which is not the affectation to become, recently.
My attempts to lyricize this stuff proved equally awful:
Come into a separate realm --
Into a disco bound in tempo to a natural hum.
Obliterate whatever's got you down.
Repudiate the foamers at the mouth.
Ugh. Best of luck to you in all your ambitious endeavors!
Good times and indeed, translations are really tricky to sort out.
Korean SOV syntax is just one part of the challenge, the other being how the adjective clause precedes the noun it modifies (the opposite of most Indo-European languages) and can be very long, which pretty much screws up every auto-translate program... and even us humans as well.

Believe it or not, the sound I mimed the paper fan over is period correct "Pre-CBS" as well, being that of the 박/bak, the "conductors clappers" used at the start and finish of Joseon-era court music (정악/jeongak). The bak doesn't do much else, but has a unique sound that I love. Interestingly enough it entered the Korean repertoire during the Goreyo era via the Chinese Song dynasty, about a thousand years ago.

I've been missing actual contact with other musicians these days. There's a series of "eye-contact" videos by bands like AOA, TWICE, EXID, MOMOLAND, STELLAR, and PRISTIN, and I play my drums along to them. I make playlists, arrange my laptop on a TV table in front of my kit, and try to incorporate the choreography and facial expressions into my playing-style -- in other words, trying to capture the overall performance spirit of each production.
Although there is an eye-contact version of AOA's killer groove ...
My go-to jam is this version of DBDBDDIB by Saturday. I love trying to turn their hops, stomps, shimmies, and floor-slides into different drum-fills. Then too, I'm also usually wearing my pyjamas, slippers, and hair curlers when I practise.

So what? There are songs - or let's just say, coordinated noises - in the charts, that are worse than K-Pop.

This movie plays on a continuous loop. Pretty young people emerge, enjoy a few years of fame and then commit career suicide by passing from adolescence into young adulthood. Some are talented and endure. Many disappear into obscurity until they write a tell-all book about bad substances, management and companions for anyone old enough to remember them.

Hence my disinterest.
Nothing wrong with pop up in my opinion. That’s how we got The Beatles, just saying.
So K- is just another extension. It’s cool. Not my jam but I must admit I’ve heard some great hooks from Seoul.
Certainly one could make the case that more effort and originality goes to Blackpink’s next single than The Rolling Stones’ next single.
The best thing about music is that it is constantly changing. Let it change.
Let kids sing goofy songs and swoon over other cute kids, that’s half of what inspires the next generation of musicians.

Many old guys just don't wanna know about anything even remotely newish. It's a waste of time to try to convince someone set in their ways.and/or stuck in the past that current music has validity. IMO...
Good on you for trying, tho...
It could be argued that the faceless (well, to me anyway) “South Korean music making factories” being objected to here, and in countless other threads about the current deplorable state of pop music, are a close descendent of the kind of music-making factory that employed people like Carol Kaye, or which drizzled gooey spooges of string section over older country radio hits.

Now that’s about as synthetic-sounding as it gets. There are no readily identifiable instrument sounds in there, beyond keyboard controllers and DAW plug-ins and whatnot.

Sure, I’d like it more if my boy Justin cranked that out with a bunch of music buddies in a garage, with real physical instruments. But I don’t think there’s any denying that musical talent is still involved in modern high-tech music-by-factory, and that makes it worthy of a listen, as much as anything.
@Flip G, I thought it was interesting what you wrote about kind of reverse-engineering dancers’ moves

Not my cup of tea but to each their own. I myself listen to a variety of music (new and old) that probably causes other people to scratch their heads (or in the case of my parents say, "We always knew you were stupid.").
If I remember correctly, I've read both Frank Zappa and John Paul Jones saying that they learn(ed) as much from music they didn't like as music they did like.
I thought K-Pop was breakfast cereal.

I visited your Quora page. I really liked "The Sleeping Princess." Enthralling! And your loving memory of Yaro Jan, stunning! I'm thrilled to have met someone involved in the production-side of K-Pop. Personally, I think Teddy Park's a song-writing genius. I loved seeing him in Netflix's BLACKPINK documentary. What a sweetheart!
Thanks so much for so clearly explaining "SOV" syntax in the Korean language as well. My wife is a professor of British Romanticism, and when I repeated what you'd said, we both got excited, comparing it to the alliterative poetry or "prosody" of Old English. How "Beowulf" and "Piers Plowman" use lines split in the middle, insofar as syllabic counts go, with alliteration replacing cadence, consonance superseding assonance. "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight", as a bridge between Germanic and Middle English poetry, being unique in that it tries to express Norse literary structures in ways pleasing to a Norman audience.
Poetry in translation is fascinating!
When you explained the Bak instrument, I re-listened to your Blackpink cover, and now know why I jumped when that fan snapped open. That sound is one I associate with every Chinese lion-dance in every Kung Fu movie I've ever seen.
And I should have known Korean music had a darker sound than its Asian counterparts. I started out listening to J-Pop (Shonen Knife, Yoko Kano), then added Taiwanese (Wu Bai – great guitar-player!), then Cantonese (Candy Lo, Anita Mui) and Mandarin (Nicholas Tse, The Twins). It was a grocery store clerk I spoke to the day after she'd seen Big Bang in Toronto back in 2015 who got me super-excited to take the plunge into K-Pop, and the first video I watched for myself was 2NE1's "I Am the Best," which still sounds so huge and dark to me. "Let's Kill This Love" comes close in timbre – full marks to Teddy Park – but yes! Dark, dark, dark! Gain's "Paradise Lost" or (G)I-Dle's "Oh My God" are up there with "Night on Bald Mountain" or "Toccata and Fugue in D Minor" in my scrambled opinion.
Have a great weekend!

I actually think he should have gone harder on the auto tune, or maybe incorporated more vocoder. Some of his other projects do. His productions are really cohesive across all of his acts (capsule, perfume, kyary, MEG, etc.). He basically just treats the vocals as a synth melody line rather than as the star in front. With him it’s more about the voicings and harmony than melody I feel.

"Korean Old Lady" ... I hear that. I hit on a couple of East Indian girls at parties during my college years by talking on and on about the Bollywood films of Amitabh Bachchan or The Apu Trilogy or the music of Asha Bhosle and Mohammed Rafi -- all VHS tapes and cassettes I could check out of the local library at the time.

There is an otherness to K-Pop that I find intriguing. However, the whole spectacle that it presents reminds me of a parade. I've never been a fan of parades. K-Pop, in many ways, comes off to me as a celebration of conformity. That's a turn-off for me in the age of surveillance.

I actually think he should have gone harder on the auto tune, or maybe incorporated more vocoder. Some of his other projects do. His productions are really cohesive across all of his acts (capsule, perfume, kyary, MEG, etc.). He basically just treats the vocals as a synth melody line rather than as the star in front. With him it’s more about the voicings and harmony than melody I feel.

Just went back and listened to that one; I see what you mean and it does have some nice voicings and harmony. Interesting approach.

There is an otherness to K-Pop that I find intriguing. However, the whole spectacle that it presents reminds me of a parade. I've never been a fan of parades. K-Pop, in many ways, comes off to me as a celebration of conformity. That's a turn-off for me in the age of surveillance.

So if you ingest salmonella from handling your pet white snake, is that what your vision looks like? Sort of an out-of-focus thermal imaging? That could be...fun.

Thanks again, @BigDaddyLH. I watched the first half-hour of Mr. Mister with lunch today. That opening scene with the insect was hilarious, as was the power struggle between the board members being seen in split-screen as their ID tags flipping around on a Go board. And then that middle-aged man at the bar portraying his life as a horror movie, and a screen appearing over the back of the bar, his woeful tale unfolding in flickering images. I very much look forward to the villains receiving their comeuppance, too: that wife, that loan shark, and that hospice nurse. Great stuff!
I just wish Netflix would translate the song lyrics. I bet that song that played over that scene of our heroes heading home on the subway ... well, I bet the words to it were the pinnacle of dearth and despair.

Why do vintage pickups sound better?
I asked a guy who owned a vintage guitar store this and he said something about how they mined better metal back in the day.
My 60s Dynasonic pickup was made by elves in the North Pole. There aren’t any more elves nowadays.

Might be a part of equation.
People have analized spectroscipically pieces of of wood from Stradivarius instruments and found an anti-wood worm agent made by a chemist from Cremona which influenced the preparati on of the soundboard and also left some mineral deposits in the material. It's supposed to have some infuence on the sound.
Perception vs. Reality?
Also, remember that in vintage times there wasn't a lot of uniformity in pickup construction, so sound can vary wildly between pickups of the same type and year. You can have some PAFs that sound heavenly, and some that are too muddy or weak etc.
This comparison is generalization at it's worst. Not all vintage pickups sound better than anything newer. You have to be kidding.
There will be an additional response if I can stop laughing. Later .........

Sound better compared to what?
A Duncan Antiquity wound to vintage specs sounds like a vintage pickup, to my ear.
A pickup not trying to recreate a vintage pickup will sound different. Better or worse is a function of what the user is after and wants to hear, I suppose.

They didn't mine "better metal," they mined ores that were converted into metal that was not "better." The combinaton of aluminum, nickel, and cobalt into a specific alloy for a magnet was the same in 1959 as it is in 2019.

"Better" is usually a subjective term. Maybe it's because vintage pickups, and their general sound (single coils, PAF's, P90's, etc.) were there when the industry was new and the "standard" expectations were set for what an electric guitar was supposed to sound like. And the enormous sales of Fender and Gibson probably had as much or more impact in that regard. Same with amps. Those sounds for decades and decades have been heard in all kinds of popular music, so maybe it's what we expect subconsciously when we listen.
Just speculating...

What does "mining" have to do with pickups? And what would be different? I guess we need more detailed info on that theory.
Do they?
Not single a vintage pickup I have ever owned (with the rare exception of a particular PAF) has been better than what is available now.
I’ve owned vintage and customs, worked at a vintage guitar shop and even the owner commented over the phone the other day, “there are off the rack modern fenders at GC that sound as good as these, this aint the 70’s anymore...”

The same thing can be said for the copper in the wire.

Back in the old days, pickups were often wound by hand (there's an old Fender 50s video on youtube and you can see sewing motors and hand winding going on). Now days it's all machine wound for speed and low cost. Do Boutique hand-wound pickups sound better? Many think so and are willing to pay $200+ per pickup set.
What you are chasing in the old hand winding creates scatter in the windings that reduces capacitance in the pickup. Brighter more clear tones not muddy and dark.
Now, if you buy some import cheap pickups ... they more than likely are hand wound like the old days. At least the capacitance measurements I've done show the import ebay pickups often have half the capacitance of the typical famous aftermarket factory brands (that often sound too muddy to me). $15/set makes the experiments worthwhile. Set them lower in the pickguard as they have hotter ceramic magnets than the alnico rods to hit the classic tones you are chasing.
If you are already stuck with a muddy dark set of pickups, try putting an 0.047uF capacitor in series with the hot lead of the muddy pickup. You can then try other values of caps but start there. This cuts the effective capacitance way down and eliminates the mud -- a boutique pickup effect for a nickel.

He owns a vintage guitar shop. He sells vintage guitars. He needs reasons to justify the high price of vintage guitars. He comes up with an idea he can promote to justify higher costs.....it's nonsense.
Many vintage pickups ended up being hand wound and their specs are all over the map. It stands to reason that some just rung every tonal and volume output bell they could ring and others did not.
What you end up with is more variation between some vintage pickup with some better than others but certainly not all. There's far less magic in a vintage guitar in reality than there is in somone's mind.
Do they?
Doood, that's so '90s.

Truth be told, the best sounding pickups have vintage impure magnets but modern ultra pure oxygen free copper.
Of course, mined metal that is only about 50,000 years old OBVIOUSLY isn't going to sound as good as 200,000 year old metal....LOL Seriously though, I think the aged product combination of magnet, and wire could have an effect on the tone of the pickup.
But I agree with some of the other posts that there are modern pickups out there that sound as good, if not better than vintage. It's a crapshoot though because the exact same spec pickups from the same maker, for whatever reason can sound (at times) quite different from each other, and ears also vary widely....

This is just... so horrible on so many levels. While there is definitely a market for metals produced pre-WWII due to contamination from nuclear fallout making post-WWII metals unsuitable for certain applications... no. That has nothing to do with "back then" or any of the rest of this Good Old Days garbage.
Vintage pickups do not "sound better." They sound different. All pickups sound different. Some will claim that over time the loss of magnetic pull has "mellowed" and that's why it sounds "better," while completely ignoring the fact that you can make a weakass magnet now without having to wait for decades.
It also ignores the fact that then, as now, guitars (ESPECIALLY FENDERS) were produced as cheaply as possible and all of the vaunted "vintage" materials that are so cherished now were just what was readily available in quantity at the time.
Modern production methods have made all aspects of the instrument monumentally better in every possible way. They're more consistent and better made from one end to the other.

Very true. Survivor bias cannot be ignored. Even now how many trash-tier vintage Fenders do you have to go through to find a "good one" by vintage snob standards? And that's well after most of the churned out dreck that was bad even by the standards of the day had been discarded, closeted, or parted out.
It's kind of like when I sold appliances and people would swear up and down that all of the old stuff was better because their grandma's Kenmore has been running since 1975, completely ignoring the hundreds of thousands of that exact same model that didn't even make it past 1979. Exceptions are not rules.
Tone is in the ear of the beholder.
I have a few guesses re: the OP's preference or impression. So I don't think his question is merely dismissable.
1) The power of association. We hear "vintage" and think resonance, beauty, talent, a Golden Age's golden bells, etc. Romantic, idealized things. Say "Ontario" to me and I don't smell poor Lake Erie's dead carp. Instead, I'm already portaging my senses to unspoiled rivers. I don't say this to ridicule the OP's associations. Plenty natural.
2) The OP simply likes the tones of low-output pickups generally. So vintage ones, which tend to be low-output, are going to sound better to him than generally more powerful modern/non-vintage ones. And insofar as degaussing is a real thing that may audibly affect old pickups (I have no dog in this fight), this further weakening of the their strength might be what the OP is hearing. Or, as per 1) above, imagining that he's hearing. (Again, with all due respect.)
3) Insofar as vintage guitars per se do sound different than non-vintage ones, I think that's a function of many of them drying out over the decades. Almost every vintage guitar I've picked up (with the exception of the infamously heavy '70s Fenders) has been noticeably lighter than contemporary versions. The lighter they are, the more they have a distinct, almost reedy resonance, even when played unplugged. So the OP may be attributing this distinctive sound quality to said guitars' pickups.
That said--yeah, not only can new pickups be wound to old specs, but they can be lowered away from the strings to sound pretty vintage. And the dials, buttons, and switches on guitars, amps, pedals, and recording programs can make probably most non-vintage pickups sound vintage-y.
I dislike the "its just pschological" default setting in a lot of threads here.
It is quite possible that the p-up WIRE was different. Not the wire s metal content , but its SIZE and COATING. Coating makes a difference not due to its chemical composition, but its thickness. And of course the winding technique as mentioned.
I had a '65 Strat p-up. It sounded fantastic. I did an A/B w a CS '69 RI, the ones initialed by Abby. Every good quality the real '65 had the CS had only more so. Better everything +. I sold the p-up for $400 to a guy who thought having a real p-up from that era for his '65 Strat he was restoring was important.
So , yeah , there s the "Snake Oil" aspect w some people, but the p-ups can be different as well.
Why? Because the internet says so.

total nonsense. more guitar BS hype aimed at selling and not speaking the truth.
Vintage pickups better than currently made pickups?
There was a time when that was probably true, mostly in the seventies. There were a lot of ****ty Fenders and Gibsons made in the seventies.
These days, and for some time now, it isn't true anymore. Pickup winding (and guitar building) has been analyzed to death and even with cheaper imported guitars there are some awesome sounding instruments being constructed.
I have a 1960 Stratocaster. It's my #1, and it's a wonderful guitar. Even if I had the resources to buy one (I don't) again, I wouldn't do it. There are countless small and large builders out there that could build me a quantum level copy of my Strat that would play and sound just as good and considerably cheaper than searching for and buying a vintage one, with pickups that sound the same as ones that are sixty years old.
because they are found in vintage guitars
I think of saying it’s all the mind... but then I play my ‘64 Casino with its original P90s and they have a depth, quality, bite and airiness that my similar spec modern P90s do not have. They sound more focussed and narrow.
I put some of it down to looser windings and dried out wax potting and magnets with 50 years of natural aging. The guitar is a system too, so the old, dried out woods and softened edges all play their part. Microphonics colour the tone a lot.
The difference between a good sounding vintage pickup and a so-so new one is about 10,000 hours of practice.
Well, some of the vintage pickups sound different, not necessarily better. I played a $60k telecaster at GC Hollywood that was in this vein. The guitar sounded like piano strings i.e. clarity and tone like when you pluck a piano string. Most telecasters don't sound as clear as this one but as others have pointed out, the magnets were almost 70 years old. The low output nature along with the decrease in magnetism plus, I'm wasn't sure the wiring hadn't shorted and I was hearing less than the full coil of the pickup. This happens as the coating on the wire ages and the wires make contact with each other and you can get an even lower output pickup as you are hearing just a portion of the coil. I believe this is the holy grail sound a lot of people refer to when talking about vintage pickups in telecasters.
On the Gibson side of things, pretty much the same thing, a lot of the holy grail Les Paul guitars from the 50s/60s have lost some magnetic properties and you start to get string clarity vs more homogenized sounding tone. The "Beast" has this property (lookup this LP) . But that said, I have a Custom Shop 58 with Burstbuckers which is a 2007 Reissue that sounds pretty much like original LPs from 1958 that I hear on YouTube. It sounds uniquely different than almost all other LPs which is why I bought it. It has this piano like quality and clarity. Just beautiful tone. I played almost 50 LPs before I settled on this one.
Last thing, the anniversary year of telecasters, 2011, had several production models with OV pickups and lighter than most year ash bodies. If you can still find one, those had a unique sound not found in your average tele. I have 3 teles and the one from 2011 is quite unique.
Also note, a lot of guys with vintage guitars are trying to get the highest dollar when selling. It's in their interest to declare the unique properties of their guitar.
I am friends with a pickup maker you all love and he tells me the magnets today (with few exceptions) are not made the same as the mags BITD.

Yeah, but can he prove it by showing the internet forum post where he learned that?
Mojo is generated by ladies bent over converted sewing machines. Modern production methods actually require whatever minute trace of mojo is generated to be gassed off to avoid clouding of contemporary guitar finishes or bubble packaging.
This is a very limited example in response to the OP's broad stroke question. I'm in love with the sound of late-70s Bill Lawrence L-90 pickups - liquid, clarity, balance, musicality; they're amazing. I bought a 1977 L-90XL off ebay and then eventually decided to buy a new, made-to-order L-90 (less powerful) from Wilde Pickups. I had em installed in an MIK Gretsch thinline semi-hollow, the XL @ the bridge and the straight up L-90 @ the neck. So that's a span of 40 years between pickup manufacture on the same guitar. The sound quality, to my ear - understanding that the bridge has that grittier snarl, etc - of the 2 pickups is seamless. To me, they sound like one pickup as I transition from all neck to blended to all bridge. And they both sound great. Wilde IMO delivered an exact match to park in the neck position. (And they did it in exactly 2 weeks.) Again, just one man's experience, ears vary, etc.

Don't forget about the unique nitrocellulose they used back then that allowed the wood to breathe. The nitro they used back then is different than what's in use today. The stuff they used in the 50s came from one of two operational nitrocellulose lacquer wells in southern california and both of those nitro wells are closed today. They no longer drill or operate nitrocellulose wells in california.
Cuz they got "game" on 'em.

And, the vintage guitar with the muddy pickups might be the one that someone pawned off in 1972 when they needed cash, and got bought by a 15 year old who painted it with house paint and it wound up in a dumpster - or maybe just some metal head replaced the pickups with DiMarzios in 1981 - whereas the guitar with the awesome pickups stayed intact and is still here for us to listen to.
We're not hearing the crappiest 25% of pickups from 1962.
We're hearing the best quartile of pickups from 1962: the survivors.
My other guess: the sounds of vintage pickups are in vogue among guitar afficionados.
If this was 1983, we'd be saying "Man these old pickups suck. We're so lucky to be living in the era of super distortion plus."

Pitch is the primary sinusoidal wave form of a note, 440Hz for "concert pitch". Tone is the harmonic structure an instrument adds to it. Tone also includes distortions of the wave form like clipping. The harmonic structure is influenced by tone controls, and sometimes the volume controls on the guitar and amp. Distortion comes from overdriving the gain or power stages of an amp or overdriving a speaker. It also comes from pedals that take a waveform input and transform it introducing changes that do not follow a harmonic curve before feeding into an amp. That's an oversimplification, for sure, but without that understanding my next comment will make little sense.
Back in 1964, I controlled "tone" using the tone control on my guitar and the treble and bass on my amp. I was a string banger and played way too loud. There was little subtlety and no nuance to my playing. Picking technique was limited to how close to the bridge I played. It didn't matter though because no one at Lawrence Road Junior High School was any better. I certainly didn't understand wave forms or harmonics in 9th grade.
Now, I can truly say that tone is in the fingers. My #1 is a FCS '69 Strat. I play primarily using the middle pickup. I can get a twang that digs dirt or a smooth jazz sound without changing from the middle pickup or changing an amp or guitar setting. I can get an acoustic like backing for vocals without touching a knob. The "tone", or at least the subtlety, comes from the fingers. I play mostly finger style but it's not so simple. I play double and triple stops. I chicken pick or use four fingers. I play jazz thumb only. I vary the way I pluck strings with my long fingers to subdue or accentuate attack. I drive my amp to breakup with thumbnail upstrokes. And sometimes I play with a flat pick. I like the "tone" I get with a Daddario Cortex 1mm. I use hammers and pulloffs and even control tone with how I pull off a string.
So really, tone comes from the fingers, at least from how they are used. A guitar isn't anything like an organ where no matter how a key is depressed, the note sounds the same. With a guitar, 90% of the tone comes from the fingers. Does it come from my brain? That's an interesting question. What I do is definitely the result of conscious thought when I'm learning a song. Playing one I know, there is no conscious thought at all except maybe to think of how I want the next phrase to sound. Then I just play it that way and more often than not, it comes out exactly as I intended.
I could never have been convinced of this in 9th grade. I could never have been convinced of this in college. All I wanted was to play louder. Back then, I bit my nails and had burns on my finder tips. Anyone in college in 1970 will know what that was about. I meticulously take care of my fingers now. That's where the tone comes from.
In my mind, I’ve always labeled the gear (guitar, pickups, pedals, amps) as creating the “sound” and the “tone” came from the technique and nuances of the player of said gear.
If my normal rig was set up onstage next to Billy Gibbons’ normal rig, and he and I switched rigs (guitars included), he would sound suspiciously like Billy Gibbons with my Telecaster/Pedalboard/Vibroverb setup, and I would sound suspiciously like Fiesta Red on his Les Paul/Effects Processors/Marshall (or Magnatone, lately) setup.
Yes, his sound (using my gear) would suddenly be cleaner and a bit darker, and my sound (using his gear) would suddenly be crunchier and brighter, but the overall tone would make each of us identifiable (if you know my tone).
Case in Point:
Years ago, as a little “stage trick,” my co-guitarist and I would trade rigs in the middle of an instrument I wrote called “Travis County Line.”
I was using my main Telecaster (which was wired like an Esquire at the time) into my pedals and Vibroverb amp; he was using a G&L F-100 with Seymour Duncan pickups, into a hard rock/heavy metal-esque pedalboard and Line 6 Duo Tone amp.
His guitar was set up very different than mine—he had high action with some super light strings (Ernie Ball something or others); mine had super-low action with a set of D’Addario XL 9’s...so the feel was pretty different.
But lo and behold, we each had pretty much the same tone on the other guy’s rig.
Yes, there were differences—his high-gain rig made it easier for me to get long, sustaining notes. The “sound” of his amp wasn’t as pleasing when I used it—because he used a totally different technique.
Likewise, he had to deal with my darker settings and low-gain sounds, but still sounded like himself, overall.
So why does gear matter?
Well, it *will* affect the sound—a dirty, grungy DiMarzio pickup that is easily goosed into distortion is not going to sound the same as a bright, spanky and sparkly Stratocaster pickup; a high-gain solid state half-stack is not going to sound the same as a vintage tube combo amp with an open-backed speaker compartment; a player stomping on a Boss Metal Zone will sound different than the same player using an Ibanez TS-9 Tube Screamer.
The sounds are going to be different, but unless the player changes his/her technique, the “tone” is going to be basically the same.
At least that’s how I interpret the terms.

Dude. The dictionary just recognized “irregardless” as a word, through common usage. Impossibly, with the same meaning as “regardless”.
And we’re worried about the fine semantics of the usage of the word “tone”?Click to expand...
Tone is nothing more than the #1 word in the guitar gear marketing vernacular. Said it before and I'll say it again, "tone" is the cleavage of the guitar universe, just a word thrown out there to get you to look, and then to buy a different pick, a more expensive cable, or whatever was hot at NAMM this year.
I keed. This is tongue-in-cheek. However, I do get tired of seeing ads where some big-time player who I have to Google to figure out what band he's in is telling me he chooses a specific pick because TONE!!, but when I hear his music his sound is a super saturated Marshall-esque sound layered with chorus and delay. Not hearing much of the 'tone' of the pick there...
I am not this cynical in real life. I do like to talk people out of buying $50 NOS/PIO capacitors for their tone pots when they never roll the tone down from '10'.

I can agree with this. Still, there is good and bad tone. I know it when I enjoy/suffer it, but don't ask me to describe it, other than delightful or painful, or in between. What you are exposing, is that many folks spend lots of money, have really nice parts and gear, but still have less pleasant tone. Likewise, we all appreciate Jack Pearson demonstrating good tone with very modest gear. Its all a wonderful mystery, propelling discussion, discovery and economic activity .

Agreed. Tone is many things besides marketing mumbo-jumbo. I get tired enough of the word that I try to use words like "sound" instead. It's not what XYZ piece of gear does for my tone, it's what it does for my sound. And, not every piece of gear has to serve to improve/increase/enhance my "tone". Sometimes it just makes the process of making my sound less difficult or more comfortable.
And now I'm off on a tangent.
Pay no attention to me, and carry on.
It’s a term used to justify spending a bunch of money and not practicing.
When I speak of a guitar player's tone I mean the totality of their musical expression: the individual voice and nuance of their playing, the attack, the vibrato they impart, the sustain, the decay, the emotion. Arguably there are elements of style which are distinct from tone, but just casually speaking I mean the whole bag of tricks. The player's voice on the instrument. Mark Knopfler and BB King are/were players with distinctive voices on the guitar, for example.
If I just talking about gear I would use tone to mean the timbre, the balance of treble and bass and so on. Is the sound full of rich harmonics that are beautifully balanced, or is it thin and one dimensional?
As far as the tone is in the fingers idea, I can see the point because I like a fat neck pickup tone but can get very close using a bridge pickup and particular picking and muting techniques. Plus of course bridge tones from one note to the next, by varying technique.
Part of my work to get more tone from my fingers includes the choice to stop depending on multiple pickups for my tonal variation.
I'm 100% certain that my fingers gained tonal range when I got rid of all my neck pickups.
It also seems clear that not every player gets this, as many get an Esquire for the cool factor but then search out wiring schemes to make it more like a two pickup guitar, or even add a hidden neck pickup.
I think it's well worth doing our own research to find out if tone really is in the fingers, or if it's just another urban legend.
Gotta give it some time though, maybe a few months of only playing a guitar with a single bridge pickup with the aim of not having a single sound.
Lots of tone options in the gear too, but that's obvious and requires less practice, or put another way, the easy way out!
I just asked my wife, a classically trained oil painter,if she uses the word TONE in painting.
She said yes, and I've also heard value and temperature a lot in the discussion of painting WRT colors and tonal gradation.
As far as the term tone deaf, I think that's an unfortunate mistake, as it is supposed to mean pitch deaf, and that isn't really even a thing. Nobody that isn't deaf is deaf to pitch, or to tone, unless deaf to all sound..
"Tone" was something I was going to find in my next guitar, amp, pickup set, modification, speaker or effect. Once I traded in a guitar only to find one several years later that looked just like it but sounded and played way better than my old one ever did. So I bought it.
It uurns out the shop guitar tech had bought my old guitar and worked on it a bit. When I found out it was my old guitar I asked him what mods he had done and what brand pickups had been installed.
He had leveled and polished the frets, tweaked the action and adjusted the pickup height a bit. The pickups were unchanged. That was all. In that case tone (and playabilty) was all in the little details.
This is the control panel of a 1964 Gibson Falcon amp. It is very similar to many amps of the time that weren't built by Fender:
See that second knob from the left? That's how pretty much every electronic device used to be. One knob. One. Just one.
Clearly, that's why players had better tone in the 60s. Their amps had a knob dedicated to it!

Hi.
Yoinks. That brought me to a sudden stop. I like my Tele neck pickup sound muchly, and pretty much only use it. Say 80% or so of the time. Certainly sounds different all the time, through user manipulation.
I guess I'm in total agreement with many here, except for which exact word to use

"The way I play, every note has a tone"!
- Waldo Otto, electric table, Red Knuckles and the Trailblazers
Merriam Webster provides 10 definitions for the word "tone" used as a common noun.
The first captures much of what I think we generally mean when we talk about "tone": vocal or musical sound of a specific quality . . . especially : musical sound with respect to timbre and manner of expression.
The 3rd is also helpful: accent or inflection expressive of a mood or emotion.
The fourth is not directly applicable but may be useful by way of analogy: style or manner of expression in speaking or writing .
Other definitions refer to reflecting differences in meaning, the effect brought about by changing light or color (could be volume, distortion, relative levels of treble, mids, and bass), and a general character or quality.
So tone refers to, for example:
the "quality" of the sound (this is in some sense subjective; in other senses it could be described objectively in terms of EQ curve, or how clean or distorted is the signal, etc.);
timbre;
manner of expression;
mood or emotions being expressed;
style; and
the effect upon the listener.
Some of this can be affected (or effected, I suppose) by equipment. I can get sounds out of a Mesa TA 15 that I can't get out of a Tweed Champ, and the other way around. Strats, Teles, and Les Pauls don't sound the same. But much of my tone just has to do with how I play. So, no matter how much I work at this, 45 or so years after first picking up a guitar, I'm resigned to the fact that my bends sound more country than bluesy and that I can groove a lot better than I can wail. Which isn't bad. But it does mean that I'll never be the lead guitar player in a killer blues band.
Now on harp, on the other hand . . .

Hi.
Incidentally I'm having this same conversation (kinda) in real life* with three lay people (i.e. keenly interested in music, but non guitar players). Just to see what they say, how they react or interpret the expression in question. Arguably without the biases we as guitar folk might be introducing.
One of them just sent this link,** which I'd never seen before, but which is also apparently fairly well known. Just thought I'd share it for interest's sake, more than anything.
I have to say, I like the idea of a thing you kick on.

* Huh? The Bad Dog cafe isn't real? I guess I meant, in my personal life, with personal acquaintances.
** in relation, I guess, to his previous observations about the terms 'fuzz tone" and "women tone" being for something that comes from the equipment, although acknowledging a particular "signature" must come from the guitarist. He questioned whether 'tone' was the best term for this though, from his perspective. I like his idea of signature. Perhaps I could endure "My signature tone is in my fingers?" or better, "The signature aspects of my tone are in my fingers." - yeah, that rolls of the tongue just dandy...

Hi.
I hear “tone is in my / your / the fingers” quite a lot.
To be honest, I’ve never understood this. To me, ‘tone’ means the quality / pitch / interval of sounds.
In other words, the general character, quality, flavour, mood, etc., including degrees of smoothness and harshness.
Or, to borrow from visual arts, the colour, hue and texture of sound.
To me, this must logically be largely a mechanical and electrical phenomenon.
If I fret a note, and then someone else frets the exact same note on the exact same equipment, I think it will be by and large, identical. It’s still human skin holding down the string, and it’s still the same plectrum or a human finger pad plucking the string. Any differences I hear in actual playing isn’t “tone,” except for any sounds produced by specific use of technique. Which can be replicated by others. It’s still a universal mechanical thing.
Now, I’m not saying different players cannot and do not sound vastly different on the exact same gear, even to the point you might deny, in a blind test, that they are using the same equipment.
I’m just saying, I don’t think this difference is “tone.”
Thoughts?

In guitar speak "tone" tends to take the place of the much more widely used music word "timbre".
Tone/timbre is what makes it possible to identify that a sax is playing a line and not a flute. Or that Howling Wolf is singing a D and not Buddy Holly. It's literally the opposite of "pitch and interval", it's everything else about a sound that ISN'T pitch. Specifically including the unique "envelope" of a sound (it's attack, sustain, and decay characteristics), it's pattern of harmonics relative to the fundamental, and it's specific resonances or "formants".
If a person can't get more than one tone/timbre out of a guitar they gotta be hitting it with a hammer.
You should be able to get a wide range by varying where you're picking the string, how you're picking the string, whether you're lifting it upwards or pushing it sideways, how much force you're putting into it, the angle of your fingers or pick, how much damping you're making with your left hand and right palm, your particular vibrato... I mean there's a million little things.
Can some people do a quite uncanny impression of a famous person speaking or playing guitar? Yep. But that only proves that there was something quite individual and recognizable about the tone of their voice or playing in the first place.Click to expand...
that handle and the head probably sound different, and you can probably get something different from hitting the body and from hitting the strings.

“Tone is in the fingers” is a metaphor. Everybody is arguing semantics: what the word “tone” means, etc.
What the metaphor “tone is in the fingers” means is if you called up the best guitarist in the world, bought all his gear, and had him deliver it, set it up at your house, and then spend a week showing you how he got his tone, you would not sound like him.
His fingers make the difference. Your fingers make the difference. Gear and all the money spent on it won’t magically and instantly turn you into (insert name of favorite guitarist here).
Practice, practice, practice. This might get you close. But, again, practice is making your fingers better, and has nothing to do with the inanimate equipment used.Click to expand...
that's style. you can't make a flanger tone with just your fingers, or pitch shifted delay. you can't make a low output single coil guitar into a fender twin sound like hot humbuckers through a rat into a dimed sunn amp. that's tone.

there is difference in tone becaus attack of the strings, where you do that, the angle of the plectrum, kind of plectrum etc etc is different with each player.
but i think the most difference is our own hearing capability
things you hear you like tone wise, a other person could find not great at all because we all have to deal with hearing loss, frequencies that are there but we don't hear as good as someone else.
and what do you get, Jeff Beck, Pete Townshend setup there guitar and amps to what the hear and like.
but both have to deal with hearing loss, but we listeners have not, ore not so much.
but his perception can be completely different.
so the best tone is what is pleasant for you in your ears, and hopefully to other to
Tone is how it sounds to you when someone is playing.
If you like it it’s tone (for days even), if you don’t like it it’s lacking tone.
How it gets there depends on everything; even how you feel about the player, if you had you coffee and what your boss told you yesterday etc...
But even with that said -a big part (probably the most important) of it is how you pick a note, how you fret the string; i.e., in your hands.

Tone as Carlos Santana Eric Clapton say is in your finger tips. There should be little difference on tone weather your on an acoustic or electric. If it does not have the tone or sustain you are looking for when you playing you acoustic, no pedal or amp will help. The pressure you put on your tips with bends ect creates your tone sustain more then any pedal. I can play Voodoo child on my acoustic, and besides loudness, feedback ect. Sounds the same. Not true 40 years ago when I picked up my first guitar. Took me many many many years to get the tone and sound out of my finger tips. Pedals and amps tweaks it, but the source of tone always starts at the tips of your finger.
'Tone' has different meanings to different folks.

This reminds me of seeing Chris Spedding live. He has a song called, "Guitar Jamboree". He plays a series of famous riffs from the greats. He doesn't adjust his guitar or amp, and uses no effects. Yet, each riff sounds unique and appropriate. What his fingers do on the frets, and the way he picks the strings, makes a huge difference in tone/sound. And he has it completely under control. This is intangible stuff. The way the hands work with the rig to bring out the artist's expression is what is so hard to imitate. That's the magic of musicians with their instruments.
"Tone" is a word that has come to mean "the way a guitar sounds."
Classically, tone meant "pitch," as in "intonation."
"Tone" is now a buzz word, but a buzz usually means bad tone.

Tone for me, is a generic term used to describe the overall sound of a combination of gear/equipment.Click to expand...
This is a good definition, but I would add the musician into the mix.
There were tons of "tone wood" videos published on YouTube a few years ago and some enthusiasts even went through the trouble of building special guitars with swapable parts to research or prove either theory. One thing that never made sense is how they ended up testing the tone. They would just pluck a string or strum a chord. The guitar produced sound, alright, but it was very uninspiring and unmusical. I personally could never hear a "tone" come out of such tests.
The playing style, in my opinion, will greatly affect the tone. I guess I would not say it's the tone of the instrument alone, I think it would be more accurate to say the tone of the instrument (amp, cable, whatever...) in the hands of that player, through whatever recording equipment or heard in whatever space we hear it. And on that particular day, I guess.
One thing that never made sense tome is how someone might say, "Oh, if you do that it will affect the tone." The part that doesn't make sense to me is the implication that the tone would somehow be not as good as it should. But that just goes down the same narrow tunnel of chasing the elusive tone. What's important is the art.
If we listen to some singers that are really able to bring out the emotion we see and hear something that's hard to describe and is impossible for others to reproduce. Even when you see a still picture of such singer, captured in the right moment, you can fee that emotion. I mention singers, for the reason that a singer is not an inanimate object, such as a guitar, so we can see where the sound is coming from (i.e the open mouth). But of course the same is captured in photos of guitar players during some memorable performances. To try to reproduce that exact "tone" is not art. It is just copying. What people have to focus on is their feelings during the particular time the are playing their music and not worry about physics they don't truly understand.
Every physical change will, yes of course, affect the tone. Even temperature and air humidity. After it rains you can hear sounds very clearly and if it's very hot metals get soft so strings don't vibrate as crisply (even a tuning fork changes pitch as temperature varies). But worrying about any of that is a bit like overthinking what it takes to walk across the room. If you overthink what it takes to make a single step, how the neurons in the brain fire a signal that's carried to your muscle, etc...) you'll never be able to walk. Let's just walk and not worry about how walking comes to be. And let's just take that old guitar, plug it in and make it rock.
Tone is the general character of the sound you hear from a guitar, and we use various terms to describe it - dark, bright, clean, dirty, smooth, fuzzy, etc.
As an amp builder, I know that tweaking an amp makes a drastic difference in the "general character of the sound". Change one dropping resistor, substitute a 12AT7 for the 12AX7 phase inverter (or vice versa), a 12AY7 / 12AX7 V1 swap, and you've changed the character of the sound, and changing the speaker can change the entire character of the amp, almost to where it's a different amp.
When the 'tone' is right, it inspires me as a guitarist, to play better!

If tone is all in the fingers of the player, why would any skilled player want any more than one quality guitar and one quality amplifier?Click to expand...
Well, first off—we like our toys and we like our gear and some of us are materialistic.
But...even though the “tone” will be basically the same, the “sound” will not.
The sound of my voice will change depending on what microphone I use—but my voice is always going to sound like my voice (my tone), unless there’s some electronic/mixing manipulation. There ain’t a mic out there that can make me sound like Adele, no matter how long I search (and she’d never sound like me, either—not that she’d want to).
Likewise, if I play a riff on my Telecaster through my Vibroverb, then play the exact same riff on my Dean VX through my daughter’s Rumble 150, the overall tone and timbre will be the same (because I’m the same player) but the processing of the sound (different scale length, pickups, amps) is different.
Also, I play differently on different guitars—not my overall, basic “tone,” but how I attack or pick the strings or how fast or smooth I can play is affected by the sustain, neck profile, action, weight and feel of the guitar. I play “prettier” on my Strat—lighter, sweeter lines—than my main pinstriped “Big Tex” Telecaster...I play harder and with more abandon on my 72RI Telecaster Deluxe than my Strat...I play faster and smoother on my G&L F-100...four different neck profiles, four different fretboard radiuses, four different body weights, different body contours (to a degree), different pickups.
This is discounting the Les Paul Junior and the Dean VX...which (again) have different scale lengths and radiuseseses (radii?) and weights and balances and body types from the other four...
On all of them, my technique, style and musical tendencies give them my overall “Tone”, but they’ll each sound a bit different, due to all the differences above.
I've always bristled at this phrase. It's imprecise and confusing, and not clear - just like bad tone!
It's unfortunate that "tone" has come to mean some sort of generic term roughly equivalent to "sound." As a term, it lacks specificity, and it invites confusion because the same word is used in music creation and guitar gear to mean something more specific (e.g., the tone knob, EQ, etc).
And it's also just plain wrongheaded. Sure, people tend of obsess over gear and nuances in choices in things like capacitors, but to suggest that gear doesn't matter is just silly.
Look at any guitarist who has played different guitar rigs throughout their career. Eric Clapton, for instance. The sound and tone of Cream Clapton (SG/335 through Marshalls(?), "woman tone") is very different from Layla Clapton (Strat into Fender amps(?), aggressive overdriven) and different again from mid-late 70s Clapton (maybe similar gear, but generally a cleaner sound/tone). Clapton, or anyone else, cannot create the "woman tone" with just their fingers. It requires certain gear (works better with humbuckers, imo) and adjustments to that gear (tone knob rolled off, volume up).
Mid-60s Pete Townshend on a Rickenbacker vs early-70s Townshend on an SG/LP/Grestch. Same style, but different sound/tone.
Same players, same fingers - different tones.
I would concede that some players will sound identifiably "them" whether they plug a Les Paul into a Marshall, or a Ric into a Vox. Somehow they manage to get "their sound" out of different rigs. But I would argue that's more about style and tone setting preferences. They're trying to dial in the sound they want. But you'll never get a Strat/Twin to sound exactly like a Ric/Vox or LP/Marshall. The gear makes different sounds and tones.
Plus if your tone is truly in your fingers, why do so many players have multiple guitars and amps and pedals? If gear choices don't matter, you'd only need one guitar and one amp.
Now, maybe I could get behind the phrase "Your sound & style are in your fingers." Of course, even then, some would argue, whether it's tone or sound or style, it isn't in your fingers at all; it's in your heart/soul/head. The fingers are just intermediaries.

i think you are basically right. When people say 'tone is in the fingers' what they are talking about is the phrasing, timing and how a particular guitarist frets and picks the note. Tone is a separate thing, for example when you switch between the neck pickup and the bridge pickup on a Telecaster (or on any two or three pickup guitar) you get a change in tone. It is how a guitar, pedal or amplifier affects the attack, decay and frequency content of guitar sound.
There was a YouTube video of an interview with David Gilmour, when he dug an old tweed Blues Jr out of a clutter of stuff on his boat. Plugged in one pedal he found in the mess. Strat of course. And he sounded like every Punk Floyd solo I’d ever heard.
No matter what we play, we all sound like us.

While you’re right—in that Clapton and Townsend have presented with different sounds with different gear over the years—you’re discounting the fact that they have changed their technique for the songs/style/phase/whatever that they were playing in different eras.
Case in point:
I saw The Who (what?) on a huge outdoor screen in a live closed circuit concert in 1989. Pete was not using the same gear that he used throughout the 60’s, 70’s and early 80’s...sometimes, he wasn’t even using the same type of instrument—he’d use an electric where he previously used an acoustic, etc...but when he’d play “Pinball Wizard”—using the technique he used when originally recording “Tommy”—I’ll be dang, it sounded like ol’ Pete! Later, when he played “Eminence Front” (not on a Schecter PT)...well, looks there! It sounded like Pete Townsend!
Some people always sound exactly like themselves from stem to stern—Stevie Ray Vaughan, BB King, Slash come to mind—but other people’s tone evolves—Clapton, Townsend, Izzy Stradlin—based on the differences in technique and style they use in a particular moment or era...and it’s not just changes in gear.
Case in point:
Listen to SRV’s two different appearances on Austin City Limits. His rig (outside of guitars) changed significantly in the 6 years difference. He went from two 1964 Vibroverbs and a Vibratone (1983) to Dumble, Marshall and Fender amps (1989)—as well as different pedals (some of which had been stolen and had to be replaced).
Both of them sounded exactly like SRV. His 1989 tone was a bit thinner—but that could have been differences in the recording and/or broadcast equipment in the six years hence.
...and either way, if I walked onstage and started playing his guitars—even if I’d been given the opportunity to tweak all the knobs to my own preferences—there’s not a person on earth who’d mistake me for SRV. I’d sound suspiciously like that idiot from Fort Worth who plays that hot-rodded Telecaster.
No matter what guitar I’m playing, no matter what I’m playing through, it always sounds like me. Sure, sometimes you can tell it’s a strat or whatever. But it’s still me.
Attack, vibrato, rhythm... all those things factor in to what you’re hearing.
Is that tone? Maybe to an extent.

Hello, what is tone? On the "Touch/Tapping" instruments, single neck or double necks, the tone is even more critical. Because you only have the volume of the string touching the fret and resounding through the pickups, it is even more critical to get the vibration re-action from the neck wood itself. I've enclosed a video or two of the experiments I have taken in building "Tension Free Necks" and bodies that resonate better. It was the Boeing Aircraft Company engineers, a long time ago who worked with me on this same problem! It was the only job I have ever had in my life which put me in the hands of these very talented engineers, as I was trying to support a family and be a musician and for 3 years worked for Boeing Aircraft in Seattle.
One day at work, as an expeditor, a big guy named Jim (a foreman on the Boeing Bomarc missile team) tapped me on the shoulder and said, "I understand you build guitars and are having some problems with the reaction and sounds you are getting". He said, "We are having a party tonight for some folks who are leaving, if you want to come up and play a little music for it we would be glad to work on your problem". Bingo! That was a great day for me.
I had been frustratingly busy for months trying to get the same volume and tone above the 11-12th frets and truly was a little troubled by the problem. Two days later they called me upstairs to the engineering floor and showed me how they decided the problem could be solved, and actually had built a mockup to show me that it worked.
For the last 50+ years, this has been what I call my Tension-Free Neck, A couple of links are following to videos I have made on this subject. Onwards and upwards with guitars. Aren't they the greatest?!

Tone for me, is a generic term used to describe the overall sound of a combination of gear/equipment.
So.. A strat through a Marshall jtm45 has a different tone to a Les Paul played through a blackface.
A guitarists style is how they execute the various techniques and mechanics of playing a guitar. Again I think the use of ‘tone is in the fingers’ is just generic vernacular to describe individual player nuance.
This is the most soulless interpretation of guitar playing I’ve ever written lol but I think it has some relevance to your point of view.Click to expand...
Hard to explain, but this works for me.
For the people who think tone really is entirely "in the fingers" I say set your guitar down and let's hear what your fingers sound like.
Very simply, to me anyway, tone is what the instrument sounds like. It is made from several factors such as the wood, strings, the pickups, the amp, quality of inter-connections, humidity and temperature, how YOU play that instrument, and how good are your ears.
I am one of those "tone is in the hands" people. I think the word "tone" has many definitions, much like the word "engineer" has many definitions. We have the "train engineer" that is actually the driver of the train... then we have the "electrical engineer" who designs circuits. Both are engineers.
My explanation of "tone" is often combined with the scenario of a new player going out and buying very expensive equipment. The musical merchandising folks want us (and new players) to believe "if you buy this you will sound better"... or "if you buy this or that guitar, pedal, or amp that this famous person endorses, you well sound better."
In this definition, the gear buying is a fallacy. Especially to an inexperienced player. For example (extreme example)... a new player doesn't even know which way to turn the tuning keys to make the guitar in tune, but he blew $4,000 on a brand new Paul Reed Smith guitar thinking he needed that much guitar to "sound right." No, the principle is "the more you play, the better you get." NOT >>> "the more money you spend, the more magically talent infiltrates your body like with magic fairy/unicorn dust." Same thing applies to throwing money at a guitar instructor and thinking doing that magically sprinkles ability into your body. NOT.
You gotta take the thing out of the case often and play/practice often, or paying for lessons does nothing for your ability. You'd be better off maybe buying some vitamins... maybe not paying fast food joints to infiltrate your body with junk... and leave the guitar instructor alone.
We live in a day and age where people with extra disposable cash can easily over-buy their first instrument. But that does not give them "tone" as far as tone = ability. They might want to first buy a KORG Pitchblack pedal tuner (or any tuner for that matter) as their first good purchase. If you can't tune the guitar, you won't be able to tell if the chord fingering you are making is right or not.
I had a fairly wealthy doctor-type guy take lessons from me one time. He played violin in school, and his parents paid $30,000 for his violin. He had the idea that it was going to be that kind of thing just starting out on guitar. I told him several times that an electric guitar these days, for a minimum amount of money, and a good intonations and setup would get him a long way into learning. He also related playing violin and reading music to what he expected to do on guitar. So, he bought a Metallica TAB book and expected I was going to show him how Metallica "wrote their songs" in this published format.
Truth is... Hal Leonard, Mel Bay, and the numerous sheet music publishing companies pay a Master's degree holding music student to sketch out the "TAB" books made for publishing. This guy actually thought James Hetfield and the guys wrote the TAB books and wrote the music they made on the Grand Staff, like Beetoven, Bach, Brahms, etc, etc that he related to as a violinist. When I told him 99% of all rock and roll guitarists on records play by ear, he never believed me. I told him the fastest way to learn Metallica was by ear, not by first having to learn a completely new language called "reading music".
He also never practiced and threw money at me as if money was the magic fairy/unicorn dust that would somehow download talent into his fingers. It does not work that way. Thus, for him "tone is in the hands, not in the gear." He had the idea he was going to go out and buy a top shelf PRS-something and he would be on his way to tone. NOT. I told him to get a $200-dollar something and bring it to me and I would set his intonation and action. He never did.
Then after a couple months he paid me for lessons, then stood me up and never showed. He did that a couple months in a row, then he was gone back to doctor-ville somewhere.
I knew he was lost when I was trying to show him how to play a Foghat song and he had never heard of Foghat. Its not like he was a baby, either, he was 40-ish by age. Never heard of Foghat? I guess... I never heard of anybody being rich enough that their parents bought them a $30,000 violin as a kid in school. I have my grandpa's violin that is over 100 years old, my grandma gave it to me for free after grandpa passed away as I was the only musician in the family. It sounds just fine to my ears...
I fully believe as we play more, practice more, and gain more experience playing the guitar, our tone on the guitar changes. Tone in this instance isn't the vibration of the string, but the ability to make the instrument do better and better things through experience.
I've taught over 100 folks how to play guitar. Some had abilities on day one and we went from there, some had just gotten their first guitar. I can tell you by experience watching the first timers, if you can't even do a G or C chord, or fret an F at the first fret, its not gonna make any difference whatsoever if your first guitar is a PRS Custom-something, or a Squire Strat with a good setup. What I usually hear from that person is noise. Lot's of mistakes, no healthy "tone" at all. It is when they start to get stronger fingers, when they show me (and I can tell) if they are practicing, that I see growth in their ability. THAT is better tone than when they started. And THAT is why I say "tone is in the hands, not in the gear."
My 2 or 3 cents...
I have not read all six pages of this, but my take is quite simply, "a great guitarist will always sound like himself"! And those lesser known, not-mainstream, great guitarists, will sound like anyone you want them to at a particular time!
I had a guitar instructor who I had idolized as a local player as a teen; think standing around the parking lot of the Franco-Vets Hall, waiting to hear your favorite tune....in the 90's I had the good fortune to stumble upon him giving lessons at a local music store, and then when that folded, in his home and our home.
Johnny could play anything, though blues and Beatles-tunes seemed to be a specialty. If you asked him to show you "Sunshine Of Your Love," his late-60's Gibson J-45 would sound JUST LIKE the tune...how about "You're A Better Man Than I" then just like The Yardbirds...he's playing an F*%#*&^g acoustic, how does he do this? Same when you saw him in a bar, playing in a pick-up band, either an old Tele or a more recent Strat, made no difference, he sounded exactly like what you would expect the song to sound like...no pedals, just a Hot Rod Deluxe.
He could teach you all the notes, but you just didn't get his feel. Gone now nine years and we miss him every day, such a fne and gentle sole. His last days sort of what you might expect "the greatest guy you never heard of" would have lived out. Sad.
It's definitely a combination. You can produce different tones with the exact equipment but different techniques. Alternately, different gear played the same way will produce different tones.
IMO... There’s principle tone, and playing tone. Principle tone has to do with the gear/settings. Playing tone has more to do with touch and note selection. In brad paisleys hands, the Tele is incredibly “twangy” that’s because he plays twangy things on it. If you give EVH brads guitar through Brad’s rig, it’s going to sound like EVH. Same thing in reverse. If you give EVH’s rig to Brad, it’s going to sound super twangy. (Maybe those are an extreme comparison) but the idea is the same. Attack, touch, and note selection have as much(probably more) to do with the “tone” of the guitar than the actual gear used.
Tone = output + feel
Tone in the fingers means to me that one person can play all these different guitars, and still wind up sounding like him or herself. There's endless variation and nuance that can be applied to the instrument, and it all comes down to the person doing the playing, not the guitar itself.
Seven pages and we still have not issued the definitive statement on tone yet?
Come on!
If we don’t redouble our efforts and get serious here, one of those other guitar forums is going to get out in front on this one!

Hi.
Once again, back to my original point. I get your point, something is happening from the player, I'm not denying that, but respectfully, I don't think the word tone is the correct one to use here. Maybe nuance, feel, articulation, or something. But, an electric guitar and an acoustic guitar just don't have the same, nor even similar tones.

Hi.
I'm not entirely sure I admit, but as already pointed out by someone, isn't tone basically the opposite if timbre? Which would mean the first statement above about your voice always sounding like you is really about timbre, and not tone? And in the second quoted sentence, the timbre would def. change?

Tone would be the quality of the sound, the brightness or darkness, thin or fat, clean or dirty, the timbre, the color of the sound. You know a saxophone is not a piano when you hear it, because of the tonal difference. Within the world of saxophones you have alto and baritone, each producing a different tone. Then you may be able to tell John Coltrane from Paul Desmond because of their different instruments, and the way they breathed into them. Your gear is the foundation of your tone, and your playing affects that tone.

Tone as Carlos Santana Eric Clapton say is in your finger tips. There should be little difference on tone weather your on an acoustic or electric. If it does not have the tone or sustain you are looking for when you playing you acoustic, no pedal or amp will help. The pressure you put on your tips with bends ect creates your tone sustain more then any pedal. I can play Voodoo child on my acoustic, and besides loudness, feedback ect. Sounds the same. Not true 40 years ago when I picked up my first guitar. Took me many many many years to get the tone and sound out of my finger tips. Pedals and amps tweaks it, but the source of tone always starts at the tips of your finger.Click to expand...
your tone will sound completely different if you put a cranked clean boost in front of your amp, let alone a fuzz or a modulation pedal. you're also going to sound different on different guitars. you style and mannerisms are what carry over, and it's honestly better to switch it up to what works for the guitar in your hands. when i play my sg i want to write first wave black metal and d beat and crust, and when i play my jag i want to write surf and goth riffs.

Hi.
In that first observation, is it not timbre that informs you of the difference?
I actually quite like the last quote though. That's a pretty neat and tidy summation.

Hi.
I hear “tone is in my / your / the fingers” quite a lot.
To be honest, I’ve never understood this. To me, ‘tone’ means the quality / pitch / interval of sounds.
In other words, the general character, quality, flavour, mood, etc., including degrees of smoothness and harshness.
Or, to borrow from visual arts, the colour, hue and texture of sound.
To me, this must logically be largely a mechanical and electrical phenomenon.
If I fret a note, and then someone else frets the exact same note on the exact same equipment, I think it will be by and large, identical. It’s still human skin holding down the string, and it’s still the same plectrum or a human finger pad plucking the string. Any differences I hear in actual playing isn’t “tone,” except for any sounds produced by specific use of technique. Which can be replicated by others. It’s still a universal mechanical thing.
Now, I’m not saying different players cannot and do not sound vastly different on the exact same gear, even to the point you might deny, in a blind test, that they are using the same equipment.
I’m just saying, I don’t think this difference is “tone.”
Thoughts?

Hello, what is tone? On the "Touch/Tapping" instruments, single neck or double necks, the tone is even more critical. Because you only have the volume of the string touching the fret and resounding through the pickups, it is even more critical to get the vibration re-action from the neck wood itself. I've enclosed a video or two of the experiments I have taken in building "Tension Free Necks" and bodies that resonate better. It was the Boeing Aircraft Company engineers, a long time ago who worked with me on this same problem! It was the only job I have ever had in my life which put me in the hands of these very talented engineers, as I was trying to support a family and be a musician and for 3 years worked for Boeing Aircraft in Seattle.
One day at work, as an expeditor, a big guy named Jim (a foreman on the Boeing Bomarc missile team) tapped me on the shoulder and said, "I understand you build guitars and are having some problems with the reaction and sounds you are getting". He said, "We are having a party tonight for some folks who are leaving, if you want to come up and play a little music for it we would be glad to work on your problem". Bingo! That was a great day for me.
I had been frustratingly busy for months trying to get the same volume and tone above the 11-12th frets and truly was a little troubled by the problem. Two days later they called me upstairs to the engineering floor and showed me how they decided the problem could be solved, and actually had built a mockup to show me that it worked.
For the last 50+ years, this has been what I call my Tension-Free Neck, A couple of links are following to videos I have made on this subject. Onwards and upwards with guitars. Aren't they the greatest?!

You may ask, what did the Boeing engineers change to give those better sustain frequencies in the upper 10-12 frets.
They found that if you remove the normal guitar truss rod which when tightened at one end to either create back-bow or forward relief that the wood was compressed between the nut and the bridge, sustain and volume was greatly reduced.
The Boeing engineers solution was to use a 3/8th inch cold roll steel bar in its place which would be pivoted through the steel rod and the neck, at about the 17th fret, acting as a pivotal point for relief and back-bow. The adjustment would be by a hex wrench entry on the back of each instrument between the neck mounting screw/bolts. By leaving a small 1/32 inch slot/separation between the neck end and the headstock all of the string tension was now being taken care of at the 17th fret pin, not at the nut end of the neck. This developed much more sustain and tone that had been previously been compressed. It also allowed for a much easier adjustment of the neck. At Bunker Guitars we have always called it "The Tension Free Neck".

This is a thorny subject. But a fun one. I don't mind entertaining the guys that think certain woods impart certain characteristics. Maybe they do. I have my own beliefs which I think I'll stick to for the moment. But I certainly wouldn't get bent out of shape over it.
When it comes to 'tone' though, people only started using that word in the last decade or so. Before that, us old guys used to call it 'sound'. As in, 'Guitarist X has a great "sound"'. I think anyway. Again might be wrong.
Then we get to the part of the argument where people claim that 'tone comes from the fingers' which is another argument in itself really and confuses the greater argument. Whatever that is!
And to pander to the fallacy of Reductio ad Absurdum, the 'tone' that my next door neighbour's kid gets out of his brand spanking new Vintage '62 Stratocaster, is not quite as good as when Mark Knopfler pops 'round for a coffee and spanks on the plank that is my early '62 Ukulele (origin unknown - but think Dad knocked it up in the shed when he was drunk). To narrow the argument even further. When Mark has a go on my early '90's Chinese Strat made by 'Squier' - well, let's just say the gap gets even closer again!
Where does 'tone' even come in to the argument by this point?
Hell, I have cheap guitars that sound great on a given day and terrible on another. Probably just me. Or maybe a bad pedal combination (only have a few though). Then I have my known great sounding guitars that just won't play ball no matter what, and no combination will make them sound less than trash. Thankfully, they always have a knack of saving me when the 'rubber meets the road', and I can rely on them somewhat more than my other guitars to sound great in a given situation.
This is all just confusing the point. The one that I didn't make very well. But I think you get me.
It's a combo of guitar/player/equipment (amps/pedals)/situation/vibe/personal mojo
The guitar is actually quite a harsh sounding instrument as any recording engineer will tell you.
It fills in the sonic range that is occupied by human speech, and that's just a scientific fact. The nasty mid-ranges. Sure it can go all the way down to bass level 80Hz and lower, and up further again than human speech, but the 'body' of its 'sound' is in this range.
With regard to those sensitivities in those ranges, we developed those sensitivities for survival. The same reason why the human eye is more sensitive to the colour Green!
To hear twigs snap in the forest (mid-range, guitar, speech), or to spot predators hiding in in the savanna (lions, other animals that wanted to eat us, including other humans that used Green bush for camouflage).
Never mind a guitarist's tone. A good audio engineer will always scoop/attenuate/accentuate certain frequencies to make the guitar sound better and to fit in with the rest of the music. This is their art and craft.
The guitar is a wild beast of an animal, for sure. Not inherently pleasant in its most native 'tone'. But certainly very pleasing to the ear when it can be made to 'sit in a mix'. Almost hypnotic. It's a paradox how something this awful sounding can be so addicting when it reaches that 'sweet spot'.
I think that 'sweet spot' is what people mean by 'tone'. Or like in the olden days 'sound'.
I like to view it as a fun argument for lively debate. But it does get a whole lot more serious when you get in to things such as psychoacoustics and psychophysics and whatnot. These things purport to bring an objective bearing on things (results) but yet still the conclusions are fought over in the subjective realm.
At a certain point, snake oil is assumed. And yeah, there is snake oil. But there is also objective truth. But subjective truth is all that most of us will ever know, so why sweat it?
I don't sweat it.
I like a real fuzzed out harmonically dissonant 'tone' when it's called for.
But I also love the real sweet ultra-harmonic 'tone' when it happens on those rare occasions:
01: Right guitar.
02: Right pickups.
03: Right amp.
04: Right pedals.
05: Right microphone.
06: Right mixing desk.
07: Right compressor (insert)
08: Right equaliser (on track channel)
09: Right converters out of desk.
10: Right recording medium (1/2" tape or DAT perhaps?).
That's a lot of things to get 'right'.
And even if you do, you probably won't do it twice.
But that's the fun of recording
And the very great challenge of capturing a guitar when it's already sounding good coming out of the amp, but it needs to go through that extra signal chain as well. Do no harm.
It's all very complicated.
But somehow, most of us seem to do 'ok', while some of us do better than others.
So keep striving for perfect 'tone' or 'sound'. Why not?
One day we'll get there.
Or die trying...
Tone is actually the tightness and color of your guitar strap.
You know, as long as we're making up our own definitions and all.

Amplifiers don't make a hill of beans difference if the tone isn't first available from the sound coming from the instrument.
Just my opinion on tone here, but when I was a young boy about 70 years ago, I was shocked when Fender built a guitar, one of which I had purchased at the time called the Broadcaster, later to become the Telecaster. The Broadcaster was made from just a block of solid wood. It was critical because the guitar that my folks had bought for me on my 14th birthday was a Black Devon Epiphone, and I thought every guitar in the world had to have some type of a sound chamber. "How Wrong I Was", yet it took many years later before I was able to understand how to get the musical sound to react from whatever source of wood I wanted to use.
First, every piece of wood is as different as the fingerprints of our hands. Here are a few items that make a difference in sound and tone. The number of laminate glue joints in the neck or body, make a big difference, less is better. Also flow of the grain/growth pattern through the length of the neck, how the neck mounts to the body. How the neck resonates/vibrates when plucked or touched. The density of the wood…I could go on and on but will stop there. A "Tension Free Neck" works better because there is no tension from the strings stopping the natural vibrations or resonance of the neck.
Secondly, I think that the pocketing of a solid-body string-type instrument should be based around the pickups chosen to be used. This is very important, but of course, has to be based on how the pickups are mounted, and if they are designed for different mounting methods: solid, spring, free-floating, etc.
One example of this would be my rock and roll "Magnum" guitar, where I took great care in making sure that I could get very different responses from the neck and bridge pickups by pocketing. It really does make a big difference! Try it on the Ax you’re building! You’ll like it too.

 Two different players on same equipment, sound different.
Tone is... like... why a show-tune singer with perfect pitch and incredible range and academic training, singing about eternal love, can grate on the ears. Conversely, a dude that hasn't showered in days, has no money, he drank a jug for breakfast and smoked a carton at lunch and sings about why his woman left him, that sounds perfect.
"Tone is in the hands" is vague and meaningless to me within the context of talking about gear AND playing, because we are talking about very different things. It's most often used in such a way to dismiss specific qualities of instruments. Yes, a good player could demonstrate musicianship and expression using nearly any quality of instrument, but that has nothing to do with the sound qualities of the instruments themselves.
Analogy to drawing: Drawing with charcoal and drawing with a pen. Each provides different qualities of visual texture. Visual texture is the equivalent of timbre in sound. Both can largely be broken down into specific differing qualities. You can't practically make lines from charcoal look the same as lines from pen and the other way around. And of course, there are many other textures inbetween and outside of those two. For example, a fine tipped pencil. A fat tipped pencil. A fine tipped marker. A crayon. A paintbrush. What you do with the tool is an entirely different sort of thing than the qualities of tools. We might call what you are able to do with the tools, artisanship, which carries over to music as musicianship. And further in both is personal expression in what you do with your tools and abilities.
Timbre is in the gear. Musicianship and expression are in the person. Put your hands in the air and demonstrate your 'tone'.

I’m just saying, I don’t think this difference is “tone.”
Thoughts?

I think that's a great definition.
Tone comes from your pickups and amp combo(electrics) or the combination of woods and bracing (acoustic). Expression comes from your fingers.
Squawk, Bends, Trills, Vibrato, Muting, etc... are techniques that we use to express our selves.
This expression is commonly referred to as "tone" by guitarist. It's inaccurate, but commonly accepted.
Consider this, if we could get our "ideal sound" using the same amps, guitars and pickups, then there would only be one type of amp, one type of pickup, and one type of guitar.

That sums it up well in a single sentence.
People here seem to be confusing tone with style.
Tone is your hardware. Style is your software.
Tone is what I had when I plugged my first Gibson electric straight into a Fender Super Reverb amp and let it rip. Back then we had tone but didn't know it!
Tone is a concept argued on the Interwebs. Everyone knows what it is, and no one knows what it is... a proud tradition we will pass on to succeeding Generations in perpetuity.

100% agreed. you're going to sound different playing dick dale's rig than you will playing the guy from mortician's rig, especially if you aren't allowed to change any of the settings.
Tone = a sound characteristic
Each guitar offers a different tone from the body, neck, hardware, pickups, electronics, control settings and setup.
The amp, all it's components and the control settings.
The players style of playing and touch.
All these things have a contribution to tone/sound.
Other factors are the room, sound/recording equipment, control settings and the people behind that equipment.
“Tone” is the same thing as “stoned”, only without the “s” on the front and the “d” on the end.
Tonedeaf test.
Reading the thread about the brains of musicians, i found this. I am pretty sure if i had taken this test when i first started playing, i would have got it all wrong.
I didn't even know you had to play in time. My classical teacher didn't bother with that, probably because she was not used to play with other people. I did some metronome exercices though. I just wished i was explained why it was important.
I probably have amusia, but after some 20 something years of playing, it is not as bad as it used to be. I can't even sing frere jacques.

My ears are fine, but I can't sing to save my life.
Is that not a joke? Seriously - it seemed absurdly and obviously simple. I got 36 out of 36, of course.
It makes me wonder though - how did others on here score? Like all the guys who scream that no one can hear a difference between maple/rosewood, ash/alder, brass/steel, different caps, etc. - how did they score? I wonder how little those guys can actually hear, and if they didn't get a perfect score, maybe they should stop telling others what they can or can't hear.....
Hmmmm that really is not much of a test. I'm not saying that because I have golden ears (I don't), but because the discriminating factors are extremely wide for all the choices where the tones are different.
Try this one.

The Australian government gives everyone a free test for anything. A very good Medicare system. Just happens I'm due for my National Hearing Test tomorrow 2:00 p.m.
Last time. at age 60 I rated really well, so too, my twin brother.
Doesn't help with ear hair though.

That's good enough for me, given my age and my hearing. So I'll continue to tell you that all wood does in an electric guitar is stop the metal bits falling on the floor

Cool test.
I'm chord and note deaf!
The amount of songs I've worked out by using my ears must run into, let me see... single figures. And they've only been by accident due to noodling.  Most times I can't even hear the bass lines. Too many years of a noisy work environment maybe (although I can hear my partner whining at me from a hundred yards).
100%

Yeah, I'd have got 100% too if I hadn't posted a screenshot
Both of those tests were jokes. The first one I can't imagine not getting 100% unless you had a physical hearing impairment. The second one was dependent somewhat on being familiar with the examples and even then it's hard to imagine not hearing the dissonance.
I had taken a different test a while back online that was much more difficult that I was still able to ace. It gave two different tones that were either same or very slightly off from each other. Much more difficult than the first test above.

If you are tone deaf, you are tone deaf. It is like being colorlind, you cannot tell if that is green or red or magenta or salmon.
Of course, i am the OP so maybe i should think more about posting threads about being tonedeaf on a guitar forum.
If you find that other test you are talking about, i would love to try it.
Tune Test: 23/26. Goes to show that I can tell when something's wrong but not when it's right.

I had a hearing test when I was 12 or so, they put headphones on and you have to let them know if you hear the tone/beep
My father was with me and the lady conducting the test, the test begins
Lady: are you hearing anything

I'm sitting next to an open window with freeway noise in the background and no headphones.
I got 30/32 correct.
Tone-Deafness Test
You listened to 32 sounds. Of those you guessed 30 correctly!
You did better than 94% of people. Your average speed was 0.9 seconds.
In this game, we tested your pitch perception ability, or the degree to which you are sensitive to very small changes in pitch. The reference tone, which played three times on each trial, was always the same pitch (A440). The fourth tone (the "target" tone) was either higher or lower than the reference tone, which was determined at random on each trial. Some of the target tones were quite a bit higher or lower than the reference tone. Those trials are usually quite easy for listeners to answer correctly. But when the target tones are very close in pitch to the reference tone, it can be very difficult to tell whether the target tone is higher or lower in pitch than the reference tone.
Cognitive psychologists use this fact of pitch perception to test whether a listener has congenital amusia, or "tone-deafness". About 4% of the general population tend to perform poorly on a test like this (fewer than 20 correct responses when listening on headphones in a quiet room), which could mean that they have congenital amusia. This is just a short test, however, so if you didn't perform very well, it might not be because you have congenital amusia. If you are interested in taking a longer, more in-depth test, please visit our friends at the International Laboratory for Brain, Music, and Sound research (brams.org/en/onlinetest). And if you think you might have congenital amusia, don't worry! While the disorder might make it difficult to perform music, it does not make it difficult to enjoy music!

My preferred rig for 20 years was a Marshall JMP half stack. I've been more into Fender Twin clean with reverb for the last 15 or so years. Do the math, if you still can, old timer....
Missed two but I blame that on rushing the repetitive nature of the pacing.
I went to elementary school in Albany GA and I was in sixth grade when the Beatles played Ed Sullivan.
I was already learning guitar chords from my auntie so I wanted to get in the chorus in seventh grade. You know, so I could be John Lennon.
The test given to get in was not unlike the test in OP. They did ask us to clap hands to a beat as well.

Did I tell you it didn't it shouldn't make any difference to you?

The caps on an AVRI '52 that make the front pickup sound like a mud sack dropped from a moving vehicle DO make a difference.

Apples : Oranges

There is nothing in that post that isn't ironic. Pitch is not timbre. Being able to differentiate pitch does not equate to differentiating timbre.
Unless your claim is that wood, caps, metals, etc affects the pitch rather than the tone.

Apples and oranges both come under the category of fruit, and timbre and pitch under hearing. Maybe you parsed a little too closely?

Meh.
I take issue with their use of the word "guessed". Guessing is what you're doing when you don't know.
The statement should be that you chose the correct answer, not that you guessed it. Oh well. It's Harvard after all.
And the first test would only be difficult if you were tone deaf.

My father (RIP) definitely WAS tone deaf. As a kid, I was embarrassed to stand next to him in church while singing hymns.....it's not that he had a "bad" voice, but he couldn't even come close to matching notes in a song. His singing was truly "atonal". He loved music, and could tell good performances from bad, but he couldn't in any way, shape or form play or perform. He made up for all that by being a great supporter of those who could play well, including being President of the Ft Worth Youth Orchestra and being a board member of the Ft Worth Symphony Orchestra, as well as a long time organizer for the Ft Worth Oktoberfest, which raised money for performing arts. While I'm ashamed about how I felt in church, I realize now that his devotion and enthusiasm in singing probably received all kinds of "Heavenly" attention.
BTW.....I scored 100% on that silly little test.

Okay, got it. I understand what you're saying. Lots of people say "you" can't hear a difference, maybe "they" can't. In theory, the materials in an electric guitar shouldn't have much of an effect on the sound and tone it produces, it's the pickups they say. In practical application I know that the guitar does influence the sound of the pickups. I don't place much stock in opinions, or reviews (which are only opinions) of most anything including guitars. I know the only guy who can hear what ( I ) hear is me!

Me too.
I have built dozens and dozens and dozens of my own guitars and partscasters since the mid 80s and I have tons of experience with how different materials affect the tone and feel of a guitar, so to me it is not even a question of "if" they affect, but "how" they affect feel and tone. I suspect that many here don't have any kind of experience with building musical instruments and just live in that zone of "in theory, nothing but pickups matter on an electric guitar", and they seem to be extremely aggressive in telling others what they can and can't hear, and I greatly resent that. I feel like other people might like to have the benefit of my experience and knowledge - I sure would have 20 years ago. But just try starting a discussion about the differences in caps and see what happens......
